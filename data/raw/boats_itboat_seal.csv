The new C-range from Bavaria was introduced in 2017. Actually, the Bavaria C57 made its debut in Düsseldorf and was nominated for «Yacht of the Year 2020» by Sail Magazine.

Exterior and interior design.

The Bavaria C57 embodies speed and comfort as the philosophy of C-line. At first glance it is hard to believe that «Bavaria is here»: such circles from Maurizio Cossutti differ from usual forms of a German shipyard. A steep stitch, wide hull, cheekbone in the stern - all the features of a modern yacht are collected here. There is also a 23.5 m high match, two tripods with genoa, Code0, gennaker and fractional weapons. The boat is optimized for a small crew: the rigging is reduced to a helmsman, there is an«automatic» stacker and two bow thrusters. The interior is reminiscent of a fashionable apartment with a spacious dining area and an off-beat kitchen. Natural wood is used in furniture production.

Amenities on board

Declared 88m2 of living space - the highest in class. It is both a spacious cockpit with fridge, grill, solariums and swimming platform, and interior spaces. For C-line the shipyard has changed the technology of furniture installation and now the customer has even more layout options available: from the standard 3-cabin with a huge owner's cabin in the bow to the charter 5-cabin.

Features

The Bavaria C57 will go down in history, first, as the first Italian design model from a very traditional German shipyard. Secondly, it is a bold step by Bavaria into the new mini-maxi yacht market.

Swimming area

Declared as being ocean-going, the Bavaria C57 does not impress with its water and fuel reserves of only 690 and 280 litres respectively. The voyages will be short but dynamic."

Amenities on board

The boat's special pride is the 2.68 meter wide swimming platform with access to the windscreen with grill, as well as a place to store the ace in the transom. The deck has a large seating area with tables as well as space for four sun beds. The Bavaria C50 is available in four layout options: three, four, five and even six cabins unprecedented in its class.

Exterior and Interior Design

The elegant Bavaria Cruiser 34 has become the most compact of the cruise series, but in its size it is much more comfortable than EASY 9.7. The cruise yacht with a Mediterranean cockpit is designed in a modern style - an understated superstructure, large roof hatches and so on. The lower deck is decorated with light wood furniture and panels designed by the yard's office.

Amenities on board

It is a pleasant surprise that on such a boat in a basic configuration there is a folding transom. It serves as a bathing platform and significantly increases the cockpit during parking. The layout of the lower deck is offered with two or three cabins. Given the size of the boat for personal use, it is better to take the first option, then there is a storage room and an increased bathroom.

Features

Two control stations are very rare for 10-meter sailboats. This allows the skipper to have a better view at any tack. The yacht is perfectly controlled by one person and for even more comfort there are three winches on both sides.

Voyage region

The Bavaria Cruiser 34 is certified for sea voyages, although experienced seafarers say she is capable of more, but a basic set for round the world is definitely not enough."

Exterior and interior design

To meet the needs of the most demanding customers, the German shipyard has launched the Bavaria Cruiser 46 Style, a sailing yacht with a Mediterranean cockpit built on the popular 45-foot model, but with a more modern design and equipment. Also the manufacturer offers a wide range of additional options and materials for the decoration, which allows you to fully customize the boat for yourself.

Amenities on board

There is plenty of space on deck for guests to relax - a cozy cockpit, wide bathing platform and sunbathing area on the roof of the superstructure. Going downstairs, you get the impression of entering the living room of the apartment rather than the boat's salon. The ceilings are over two meters high and there are generous spaces and wide aisles. There is a choice of three cabins, where the owner is given a spacious room in the bow or a four-cabin option for charter.

Features

When designing the designers paid attention not only to the comfort of the holidaymakers, but also took care of the crew: two control posts, traditional location of winches and equipment, easy access to the boom and other pleasant details. Perhaps the only drawback in the cockpit, as in other «Bavaria», is a removable bathing platform ladder. Of course, it is quite easy to remove and install, but it is also easy to drown and the detail in addition takes up a lot of space in the locker.

Swimming area

It will be a pleasure to spend a week or two on such a boat, furrowing the ocean with friends or family. It is well prepared for big journeys."

The Contest Shipyard has traditionally been very careful to expand its range of yachts. According to the designer Georg Nissen, for many years now the shipyard, which «has been designing all boats without exception, has experience in designing a successful 50-footer, it is impossible to take at once a 60-footer, so these are different boats. This is why for many years all the yachts in the range have differed from each other in length by no more than 5 feet - it was a kind of step in the size «range.»
But times have changed. Customers - especially Russians, who were the first customers of the 72nd - demanded larger and larger boats. To keep up with the competition, the shipyard took a chance and made the 72-foot model - its future flagship, whose first hull will be launched this summer.

Contest 42CS is a boat, a bit unusual for a shipyard. Usually for its models the firm chose the North Sea architecture with a central, well protected cockpit and one helm in its center. But the new 42nd was an exception - the shipyard decided to try the classic layout with the aft cockpit and two handwheels, which were placed in a favorable position.
The reason for this is simple - usually relatively small yachts do not go for long distance cruises, where good cockpit protection is important, while the aft cockpit with two handwheels looks a little more spacious.

The entry into the custom yacht market was planned back in 2014, when Grand Soleil got out of Bavaria's control. At that time, the new management decided to change the positioning of the brand to include cruise and custom yachts in the range. The first special project in 2016 was the GS80 Custom.

Interior and exterior

Grand Soleil positions the custom series as a separate brand. Moreover, a shipyard in Fano has been created for this project. The GS80 is fully designed «by» Ceccarelli Yacht Design, so it came out in a racing look. The cruising component is reminiscent only of the C-shaped sofas in the cockpit (up to 10 guests).

The launch of hull number 1 was announced in summer 2018, but actually Essentia (boat name) touched the water in February 2019. It is made of carbon fibre with a sight for the competition. This is one of the options available to the potential owner. Also Grand Soleil Custom offers a wide range of interior configurations, power units and so on. In a word: Custom.

Amenities on board


The first boat of the GS80 project became minimalistic to save weight. But experts of the shipyard allow installation of various additional entertaining and auxiliary equipment, exactly as well as more chic in living quarters.

Features

Almost 30 m carbon body is the first in Grand Soleil history. Ceccarelli Yacht Design recognizes that combining sports performance with cruise facilities is not easy. Perhaps this experience will take Grand Soleil to the next level.

Interior and exterior

Grand Soleil 48 was born in collaboration with Cantiere del Pardo and Nauta Yacht Design (interior and deck) and Marco Lostuzzi (hull design).

Modern in every respect, Grand Soleil 48 is fully in keeping with the concept of a custom yacht. The customer has a wide range of options, right down to the hull material. In the Performance version it is polyester resin and GRP. The Race version can be vacuum-formed with polyester resin or with carbon fiber. Other differences of the Race version are the reduced weight by 1 ton, longer pylon and bowsprit, location of winches in the cockpit, dirty interior and special sailing wardrobe.

Amenities on board

The interior of Grand Soleil 48 is an example of modern style: straight lines, tones of light oak and abundant natural lighting for large windows. The size of the boat allows a comfortable organization of space. Nothing «squeezes»: shower cabins, galley, dining area, full navigating table - everything has sufficient dimensions. The same goes for the cabins.

Exterior and interior design

The legendary Grand Soleil 34 was designed by Finot Studio in the 70's and graduated until the early 80's. Today, the shipyard has decided to return a successful project and has launched a restyled version of a sports cruising yacht. Skyron Studio participated in the development of the new GS 34, which helped to create a more productive hull and took care of the comfort level usual for modern yachtsmen.

Amenities on board

However, in paying tribute to tradition, the manufacturer has placed more emphasis on sports than on amenities. The cockpit is fully dedicated to the work space of the skipper and sailors, there are no recreation areas and the usual table. For the sake of weight saving, the bow cabin is not even separated from the salon. However, the lower deck is slightly inferior to cruisers. There's a good galley, dining area, bathroom and a separate cabin aft.

Features

Unlike her 39-foot sister, the cockpit is more comfortable, with the gyke's epaulet shifted behind the work area (closer to the stern), which allows her to move freely around the cockpit without fear of tripping. During the regatta, the bow cabin adapts easily to the storage of sails, and the absence of a door becomes an advantage.

Swimming area

Grand Soleil 34 is prepared to go out into the ocean. The boat is designed for active yachtsmen who can and love to work with sails."

Marco Lostuzzi and Nauta Design are responsible for the development of the range. The classic cockpit rims are connected to a modern clean deck, where straight lines and smooth surfaces prevail. The rigging-free cockpit with optional gypsum frame looks spacious. For privacy, an additional lounge with awning at the mast will be suitable. Inside is also a classic: the galley is on the right at the entrance, while the dining area is almost the entire length of the cabin on the left. There is little natural light in the cabin - there is only one hatch in the pillowcase.

The only option available in the layout is a forward cabin for the captain. Much more noticeable is the difference between LC Sport-version, where there is no table and frame in the cockpit, but the area of sails is increased by 14 sq.m. There are three fridges, an optional desalter, air conditioners and a dinghy garage aft. All berths are over 2 meters long and the cabins are very spacious.

Sun Odyssey 349 debuted in Paris in 2013. She was awarded the Sailing World Yacht of the Year title in the USA in 2015. By that time over 100 hulls had already been built.

Exterior and Interior Design

The 349 by Marc Lombard replaces his own project SO33i. At the time of launch, the SO349 was the smallest model in the Jeanneau range and received good feedback on the layout of the cabin and cockpit. The puffiness of the hull (3.44m at 9.97m) is concealed by a low superstructure, while the extended sides add volume to the interior. Instead of a single rudder post, two rudder pens, a bathing platform, an optional range without an ahterstag and three keel versions are added.

Amenities on board

With a similar layout to the 33i, the SO349 saloon became light and airy, with the addition of windows on the sides. Two and three cabin versions are available. The advantages of the first are a large storage room, a full bathroom and a wider aft deck chair. In the forward cabin, an interesting solution with double doors is used to increase space.

Features

The large sail area turns a family cruiser into a nearly sporting boat, adding to the experience for the family crew with children or guests. At moderate cost, the SO349 will not crush the family budget and will give many discoveries.

The Sun Odyssey 349 is perfect for weekend cruises or holiday coastal voyages. With 130l of fuel and 206l of water, the family can spend a night or two in a «wilderness» parking lot."

With a focus on ease of handling and stability, the Shipman 63 is designed to offer an exceptional sailing experience.

Exterior and Deck Features

Constructed entirely of carbon fiber, the Shipman 63 boasts a stiff yet light hull, enhancing both performance and stability. A key feature is the rotating carbon anchor arm, which neatly stows the anchor when not in use, keeping the bow clean. The flush hatches and well-maintained teak deck add to the yacht’s streamlined aesthetics. The yacht also features a twin-spreader carbon rig and carbon rigging, which contribute to a smoother, more stable ride at anchor, with less pitch and roll.

Cockpit and Sailing Capabilities

The cockpit is designed for both comfort and functionality. With push-button winches and engine controls conveniently located near the helm, the Shipman 63 can be easily sailed short-handed. The addition of a sturdy bimini provides ample shade while offering strong handholds for safety. The helm station is equipped with a chart plotter and engine controls integrated into the aft cockpit table, ensuring they remain accessible while minimizing glare.

Interior and Layout

Below deck, the saloon is spacious and open-plan. The Shipman 63 offers three ensuite cabins. The owner’s cabin is full-width with a double berth, a sofa, and ample storage. Large hull windows flood the cabin with natural light, creating a bright and airy atmosphere.

Conclusion

The Shipman 63 combines advanced construction techniques with luxurious living spaces and excellent sailing performance. Whether for short-handed sailing or extended cruising, this carbon fiber yacht is a fantastic blend of comfort, innovation, and reliability, making it a prime choice for sailors seeking both performance and style.

Solaris 55 offers a solution to the eternal dilemma of choosing a fast or comfortable yacht. In addition to excellent dynamics, this boat offers comfort as on a«clean» cruiser.

Exterior and interior design

The design engineers of the shipyard's design department, together with Javier Soto Acebal, spent over 14 months creating this project. The yacht is not only fresh in design, she is practical and well thought out in every detail.

Amenities on board

All three cabins have en suite bathrooms. The master stateroom is available with a central bed or offset on one side. The forward sail storage compartment can be replaced by a hired crew cabin. The yacht is designed for long periods of autonomy thanks to large storage facilities, including in the galley.

Features

Among the important features of Solaris 55 are a high-speed hull with a wide stern as in ocean racing boats, good stability due to a ballast ratio of more than 40% and an optimal sailing wardrobe. The safety of the yacht is further enhanced by watertight bulkheads laminated into the hull and deck structures. The presence of an automatic staysail, the compact location of the electric winches and working ends next to the steering posts make it easy and safe to operate the boat even with limited crew. There is a special compartment on deck for the rescue raft and a tender garage is hidden behind the hinged transom.

Swimming area

The yacht is suitable and certified for sea and ocean cruising. The deposition of Solaris 55 in the base is 3 m, but an optional shorter keel is also available."

Solaris 50 is a large and powerful boat for small crews in the optimal size. It is comfortable both to walk in relaxed mode and to race.

Exterior and interior design.

The balance of the yacht, designed by Javier Soto Acebal, is confirmed by excellent dynamics and a smooth, steady ride. The interiors were created by Lucio Micheletti together with the yard's designers. The same team worked on the younger model, the Solaris 47.

Amenities on board

The living deck space is used in the most practical way. The large galley, fridge and storage areas are invaluable on long cruises. The master stateroom is located in the bow of the boat and the two aft cabins are twin and double.

Features

The Solaris 50 can easily be operated by a couple of people, thanks to a self-tilting jib, a grotto, a twisting inside of the boom, electric winches located at the steering posts, and a single point attachment for the boom. The cockpit guest area is equipped with a removable waterproof spray.

The integrated bowsprit allows Solaris 50 to carry a gennaker or code zero. The bow storage compartment for sails is large enough so that an additional cabin for a hired captain can be arranged if desired. The tender is stored in the aft garage and there is a special compartment for a life raft.

Swimming area

The yacht is certified for ocean cruising. The sediment of Solaris 50 is 2.8 m, but the standard keel can be replaced, so the boat can enter the water area with a depth of 2.3-2.6 m."

Launched in 2018, Wauquiez's Pilot Saloon 42 only caught the eye by 2019. After a second visit to Düsseldorf, the 42nd model has been included in the list of nominees «for Yacht of the Year» in Europe and has been voted Yacht of the Year in the USA by Sail magazine.

Exterior and Interior Design

Designed by the Berret-Racoupeau studio, the PS 42 is modern but elegantly restrained. A stitch, cheekbones, designer portholes, two rudder pens, an optional hybrid - all in the spirit of time. But the width of 4.34 m (at 13 m length) says that speed is not the main thing. And the main thing is the comfort of the owners in long-distance swimming. Yes, you have noticed the circular glazing of the interior, but did not guess how much light it gives. Yes, you expected the two-cabin layout to be spacious, but you'd be surprised at the comfort of the master suite aft. It's worth touching the sofas and the wood to remember: the company's founders were in leather until 1964 - they know a lot about materials.

Amenities on board

In the basic two-cabin version, each pair has its own separate shower and bathroom. The cockpit has large sun loungers and the teak flooring will make moving around the yacht very pleasant. For long journeys it is worth adding an optional washing machine and dishwasher.

Features

The modest appearance of the Wauquiez PS 42 impresses with little things. Firstly, the spaciousness of the salon and cabin. Secondly, there are a lot of comfortable chandeliers and devices. Thirdly, high quality finishing materials. Pleasant detail: panoramic glazing is dimmed by turning the switch.

The Wauquiez PS 42 invites you to cruise the seas and oceans in the comfort of this boat."

Discover the Allures 45.9, a compact yet versatile all-terrain cruiser, perfect for your yachting adventures. Measuring 14.7 meters in length, this sailing yacht, designed by Allures Yachting in collaboration with Berret-Racoupeau Yacht Design, seamlessly combines elegance with outstanding performance. Crafted from aluminium, and known for its unrivalled strength, the yacht guarantees maximum protection and peace of mind on the open sea.

Allures 45.9 boasts a beautifully designed hull that requires no deck reinforcement, thanks to its inherent strength. This yacht can withstand collisions with anything weaker than granite, ensuring your safety at sea.

The model offers three unique layouts: Owner, Family, and Family+. The Owner version features a spacious storage room in place of the starboard aft cabin, ideal for extended journeys. Additionally, the aluminium aft arch allows you to attach various peripherals, such as antennas, solar panels, or dinghies.

What sets this yacht apart is its innovative combination of materials. The deck and superstructure are constructed from composite, while the hull is made of lightweight yet durable aluminium. This design significantly reduces the yacht's draft, making it suitable for shallow waters without compromising stability. While it may not be a speed demon, it can comfortably achieve speeds of 7-10 knots in favourable winds.

Allures Yachting's signature blend of an aluminium hull and composite superstructures results in an elegant, ergonomic, lightweight, and well-insulated vessel. This unique combination optimises weight distribution, enhancing overall performance and passage-making.

Notably, the lifting keel, featuring a slightly bulbous shape, carries the ballast with a lower centre of gravity, providing additional stability. The carbon mast and rod rigging further reduce weight, enhancing the yacht's speed and overall performance. Even with the keel raised, the limited draft allows access to remote anchorages."

Alphena One was the first model of the shipyard to set the style and direction for her work. Despite its relatively small size, it took more than a year and a half to build this exquisite cruiser, which only went well after the famous ocean racer Luyk Peyron joined the company.
Alphena One is a lightweight and high-speed yacht designed for a crew of two to six, but it is also acceptable - in the company's opinion - to sail alone. This is no surprise, because Louis Peyron is a recognized master of single racing. The boat has a great energy efficiency, which makes sailing on it rather sporty. During the course under the gennaker, the energy efficiency of the boat is close to the notorious 50 m²/tonne«, which»allows the yacht to go on full hydroplaning.
Another unusual feature of the yacht is the inverse tilt of the stem, which lengthens the KVL and partly gives the hull a wave-piercing quality. A developed configurator on the shipyard's website allows the customer to choose a large number of color schemes of the boat design.

The French Alubat has won its good name thanks to aluminum single hulls. But why not catamarans? The first model of the future Ovnicat 48 range was presented in Le Grande Motte in 2018.

Exterior and Interior Design

Like the entire Ovni line, the Ovnicat 48 looks simple and modern. The project was created by regular partners of Mortain & Mavrikios shipyard, and the interior was designed by Lasta studio, known for its work with Bali. Given the size of the boat, the interior and cockpit are more than spacious.

Amenities on board

In the basic layout, the owner has the entire left hull with a cabin and his own bathroom. The right hull accommodates two cabins and a common bathroom. The layout of the salon is typical: galley, lounge, panoramic glazing. No flybridges - you will get all your impressions at the point of arrival (probably across the ocean). Attention is drawn to the interior lighting - a find of a young designer Samara Last from Tunisia.

Features

This boat is clearly not for the charter market. Rather, for long journeys by a small company. It looks nothing special, but the only aluminium catamaran on the market is a big feature in itself.

The advertisements announced that this catamaran would take you to Patagonia, the Galapagos or Oceania. Given the shipyard's reputation, this is real. It's up to you to make time, and a boat with an honest category «A» will not fail."

The new model of the famous French shipyard Alubat OVNI 450, presented in 2018, is a development of the successful OVNI 445 by designer Marc Lombard.

Exterior and interior design.

The bypasses of the OVNI 450 are inherited from its predecessor, but the stern has become much wider. There was free access to the cockpit, which was also redesigned, added a bathing platform and two handwheels. The mast is now taller and sailing is increased.

The interior is made in tones of light oak, with a large table, an extensive galley and a full navigating table. Thanks to the addition of portholes, the natural lighting in the interior has been improved.

Amenities on board

The rigidity of the aluminium casing means that no bulkheads are used, so the shipyard offers six interior options. It can be 2 or 3 cabins, one or two latrines; the layout of cabinets and lockers is also a choice for the customer. Another option: rigid roof in cockpit for rough seas.

Features .

The reputation of the Alubat shipyard speaks for itself. OVNI 450 is an aluminium Explorer yacht with a lifting keel and the possibility of draining at low tide. You should not expect high speeds, but you can be sure of safety and comfort when travelling with family or friends. This is a boat for those who know their plans and possibilities well.

Swimming area

Alubat OVNI 450 has a category A certificate - long autonomous voyages in the ocean."

The main emphasis when creating the C 1150 was on two features: a spacious cockpit and good sailing characteristics. Unfortunately, it is quite difficult to combine a large cockpit with a large salon, so the latter is quite modest in size. But the other rooms are spacious: the C 1150, like most other models of the firm, has only two cabins. The sailing qualities of the yacht are on a rather high level for a comfortable cruiser.

The C-Yacht 1050 is the smallest sailing yacht model on the market today with a North European architecture, characterized primarily by the central cockpit. This layout has two important advantages: it increases internal volumes (more air in the aft cabin or cabins) and provides good protection for the cockpit in difficult outdoor weather conditions. All this is fully present on the C 1050 - her aft cabin is very spacious and the cockpit is well covered from waves and splashes.A certain disadvantage of this layout is the reduced size of the cockpit, so yachts with North European architecture are preferred by «practical yachtsmen who appreciate»the seaworthiness of their vessels and their ability for long and safe passages in the open sea. The C 1050 fully meets these requirements.
The long experience of this shipyard has developed its own special style of decoration and interior layout. The C-Yacht 1050 is of the same high quality as its bigger sisters and, due to its seaworthiness, is suitable not only for short voyages but also for long distance crossings.

The C-Yacht 1130 ds is a bit of a mansion in the yard's model range. Against the backdrop of the rest of the boats with their characteristic smoothed architecture, the 1130 ds with its flat lines looks a bit rough. This yacht is the first attempt to combine the architecture of an elevated salon (hence ds - Deck Saloon) with the exterior styling of the Pilot House. The interior layout of the yacht is interesting - despite her rather long length she has only two cabins: very spacious bow and stern, more modest. The rest of the space is a salon, galley, navigator's seat and a very large area of latrines. Under the cockpit there is simply a huge locker.
Initially, the design of the yacht was not intended to be the fastest in class, but rather to be a leisurely cruiser, comfortable and safe for a small crew. In the gentle breeze, the boat, though light, has low energy levels, is almost helpless under sail, especially on sharp courses.

The flagship of the Danish shipyard Quorning trimaran Dragonfly 40 is presented in Düsseldorf in 2020.

Exterior and Interior Design

Dragonfly 40 is not just a scaled 32 model, but a completely new project. Designed by Jens Quorning and Steen Olsen, the trimaran looks like a single hull. The clean deck, extensive glazing, spacious cockpit is divided into control and relaxation areas with an optional bathing platform. The helmsman has everything at his disposal: schools and halyards, three electric winches at each post. Sails, kayaks and other useful features are stored in the side hulls. The salon is finished with high quality materials in Scandinavian style. There is a full-fledged galley, dining area and toilet with shower. The height of the ceiling is impressive - 1.95m!

The amenities on board

Dragonfly 40 has cabins in the bow and stern, the latter called the master cabin, though without windows. Additional berths can be arranged in the saloon by adding up the dining table. According to the shipyard, up to 10 people can rest in the salon and cockpit at the same time, but it seems to be tight.

Features

Dragonfly 40 is available in two versions: Touring and Ultimate. The difference is in the area of the sails. The keel and rudder pen are elevating for safe drainage. Trimaran is full of engineering wonders, everything is thoughtful and good. Hence the considerable weight.


Swimming area

The Elan E4 is a sailing yacht designed by the creators to incorporate all the experience gained by the company in creating universal racing and cruising yachts. «No compromises»,"" says the shipyard. Elan. - We«create yachts both for racing and for comfortable sailing, the client's task is to decide what he wants to do today.

The aggressive, sporty design of the Elan E4 will leave no one indifferent. The T-shaped keel provides the yacht with a low center of gravity and two rudder pens to optimize control of the boat with a large heel. Rotating consoles with plotter allow you to control all the controls without leaving the steering wheel open. As Rob Humphreys himself noted, speaking of the Elan E4, «perhaps one of the coolest things about this boat is how easy it is to operate, especially in difficult weather conditions. The retractable bowsprit (optional carbon fiber) allows for the carrying of a large gennaker. «The clean», protruding fore deck surface provides the tanker with safer and lighter sailing conditions.

Thanks to her wide hull, Elan E4 has a spacious living area with two cabins. The galley, dining room, bathroom, perfectly equipped navigating table - everything you need for a comfortable stay regardless of the weather.

Construction of large expeditionary vessels to order was a specialisation of the French shipyard for decades. Now the experience passed to the Exploration series of aluminium sailing yachts. Designed by the same Berret Racoupeau Yacht Design studio as the internationally awardede 45 and 52 Garcia models, Exploration 60 was able to get away from the angularity of early models of the yard. The yacht features a clean deck, a fast superstructure with cockpit protection and a radar frame on the stern that resembles a dashing car. The circular glazing with a 270-degree view in the main deck is good for all types of weather. 

It's important to note that the Exploration 60 suits both travels with and without the crew. Therefore, there are three versions available from 2 to 4 cabins. In the two-cabin version, owners will enjoy the comfort of a huge aft cabin. Unusually, the bed in this cabin is shifted to the port side. In general, Garcia creates comfortable expedition yachts, and Exploration 60 does not spoil this reputation.

Fully aluminium, Garcia Exploration 60 matches experienced travellers who have already owned other yachts and are ready to go further than others. Serious insulation of the interior helps to avoid high latitude cold and the heat of the equator.

Certainly, the hull of Garcia 60 is designed for a long stay in extreme conditions with comfort for the crew. A fuel tank for 2,500 litres and 800 litres of water costs nothing. According to the shipyard, the yacht is capable of 1000 hours of transition under the engine."

Exploration 45
Period of manufacture
from 2014",https://itboat.com/models/4795-garcia-exploration-45,"Garcia Exploration 45 Overview

The Garcia Exploration 45 is a robust and versatile yacht, designed for extended cruising and exploration. Conceived by renowned sailor Jimmy Cornell, this boat is tailored for adventurers looking to explore remote and exotic destinations with safety and comfort at the forefront.

Design and Construction

The Garcia Exploration 45 is constructed from aluminum, providing a strong, durable hull ideal for withstanding harsh conditions. The aluminum construction offers not only robustness but also the flexibility for modifications and repairs, crucial for long-term cruising.

One of the standout features is its centerboard design, which allows for a shallow draft when the board is up. This feature enables access to shallow waters and remote anchorages that other blue water boats cannot reach, while maintaining stability and safety in deeper waters.

Safety and Practicality

Safety is a paramount concern in the design of the Garcia Exploration 45. The boat includes several watertight bulkheads, creating a secure environment and minimizing the risk of flooding. The crush box on the rudder stock is another notable safety feature, designed to absorb impact and prevent damage to the hull.

The cockpit is designed for both safety and comfort, with a hard dodger providing protection from the elements and all sail controls conveniently led back for easy handling. The dual helm stations offer excellent visibility and control, enhancing maneuverability in various conditions.

Self-Sufficiency

Self-sufficiency is a key aspect of the Garcia Exploration 45. Equipped with solar panels, wind generators, and a hydro generator, the boat can generate power independently, reducing reliance on shore facilities. This setup ensures continuous power for essential systems like autopilot, refrigeration, and other onboard electronics.

The boat also features extensive storage for provisions, allowing for extended periods at sea without the need for frequent resupply. The large water and fuel tanks further enhance its range and autonomy, making it ideal for long voyages.

Interior Comfort

The interior of the Garcia Exploration 45 is designed with comfort in mind, featuring well-insulated living spaces that maintain a pleasant temperature in both warm and cold climates. The saloon offers panoramic views, creating a light and airy atmosphere, while the elevated floor provides ample storage space below.

The yacht includes a master cabin with an ensuite bathroom, a separate sea berth for use during passages, and additional cabins for guests or crew. The interior design balances practicality with comfort, ensuring a cozy and inviting living environment.

Performance

The centerboard design not only allows for shallow draft navigation but also improves the boat’s performance downwind. By retracting the centerboard, the lateral resistance moves aft, reducing the tendency to broach and making the boat more stable and manageable in following seas.

Conclusion

The Garcia Exploration 45 is a well-thought-out yacht that combines safety, self-sufficiency, and comfort, making it an ideal vessel for those looking to embark on long-term cruising adventures. Its robust construction, practical features, and thoughtful design ensure it can handle the rigors of extended voyages while providing a comfortable and enjoyable living experience on board."

J/111
Period of manufacture
from 2012",https://itboat.com/models/1881-j-boats-j-111,"J/Boats J/111 Overview

Model J/111 has been designed, according to the shipyard, to be «the fastest and most easily operated yacht of its size on the market. The result is a very fast boat that can reach speeds of up to 9 knots on sharp courses and double-digit camp numbers on full courses. It's hard even to list all the regattas in recent times, where J/111 was in the top three in IRC or ORC handicap.
Another great advantage of J/111 is its ease of control and handling. Two people are more than enough for any work on this boat, even for staging and cleaning the spinnaker. If you don't need a spinnaker, you can walk alone on this boat.

Maxus 28 is Northman's bestseller, a boat that combines comfort and spaciousness very well with walking and navigability. The interior is very good for a 28-foot boat - it is no longer a cruiser or even a weekend cruiser, but a full-fledged small cruiser, especially in the cruising version - with two isolated cabins. Comfortable and well-equipped galley, spacious dressing room with washbasin - all this will brighten up the leisure time of the crew on board.
The yacht's cockpit is well adapted to a crew of four and is spacious enough to work with sails and to relax. She is fast and maneuverable under the sails, turning out on the patch.

Decksaloon 45
Period of manufacture
from 2013",https://itboat.com/models/1527-moody-decksaloon-45,"Moody Decksaloon 45 Overview

The Moody 45DS was the first model to be refreshed after the shipyard moved to Greifswald. Ideologically conceived as a ""sailing yacht for people used to motor boats"", her main feature was a high saloon with the floor level at the same level as the cockpit deck. Thus the similar gangway down to the saloon has completely disappeared - a thing that is extremely annoying for many yachtsmen (run up and down!). This is why the 45DS looks like a motor yacht to which the mast with sail has been attached. This unusual architecture has resulted in unusually spacious lockers, which makes it possible to take extremely long sails or use the yacht as a floating house. Borrowed from Wally, the ""solar gallery"" - a chain of skylights located in the engine room - illuminates the interior well.
Another unusual detail of the 45DS is the massive and high bulwark, making the stay on board very safe and dry, even in stormy weather."

When it was time to replace this great boat in production, yet 35 years was a good time to create a new model Nauticat 441 carefully so as not to spoil anything. After all, as you know, the best is the enemy of the good. The new boat lengthened the KVL, changed the area and rudder position, improved the deck layout and appearance of the deckhouse.

The Nauticat 38 is one of a number of traditional motorsailer yachts that combine roughly equal performance under both sails and engines. Despite her respectable age, she still enjoys great popularity due to her good balance of qualities: the boat sails well, but the sailing under the engine is stable, fast and comfortable due to a powerful power unit with good sound insulation.
The fuel reserve of the yacht is such that it allows for very long sea voyages under the engine."

Nautitech started releasing Open 40 (as well as the 541st and 542nd) before the Bavarian «takeover. Today it is the most compact sailing catamaran in its range. The boat's naval architecture and exterior was designed by Marc Lombard, while the interiors were by Roseo Design. The result is a rather functional, relatively inexpensive and interesting multihull.

Amenities on board

A large area on the boat is occupied by the aft terrace, apparently, the manufacturer thought that the main time holidaymakers will spend on it. There is a dining area and two control stations on both sides, shifted backwards as much as possible. At the fordek you can sunbathe while enjoying the coolness of the water on the net. There is not much space inside, but there is a full kitchen and a small table with sofas.

Features

From the roof it is very comfortable, and most importantly, it is safe to work with the sails. The boat comes in two versions - for private owners and charter. The first version implies a three cabin arrangement where the owner's cabin occupies the entire left float. For charter, there is a version with four cabins.

The Nordhavn 56 Motorsailer redefines long-range cruising by blending the best of motor and sail capabilities. Designed for those who seek efficiency, reliability, and flexibility, this vessel offers the option to motor at displacement speeds or use sails for enhanced performance and safety.

Dual-Mode Performance

While the 56 MS can achieve a steady 9-10 knots under motor power, the sails allow it to switch into ""motor sailing"" mode. This combination extends its range and provides a backup propulsion method, ensuring the vessel remains operational even if the engine fails. The sails enhance fuel efficiency and add a layer of safety, offering an alternative propulsion option in challenging conditions.

Spacious, Smart Layout

The Nordhavn 56 MS maximizes interior space without sacrificing comfort. The saloon and pilot house, though slightly more compact than on typical trawlers, still provide a roomy, functional area for navigating and relaxing. The design eliminates traditional side decks, freeing up more space within the saloon and giving it a more open feel. Two side doors in the pilot house offer direct access to the foredeck and cockpit, making movement around the boat convenient.

Exceptional Engineering and Build Quality

As with all Nordhavn models, the engineering and build quality on the 56 MS are exceptional. Though there isn’t a traditional walk-in engine room, the engine compartment is easily accessible, with all major components well-organized and easy to reach for maintenance. Nordhavn's craftsmanship is evident throughout, particularly in the fine woodwork, making the interior both elegant and durable.

Ease of Sailing with Modern Systems

The Nordhavn 56 MS leverages advanced sail-handling systems, making it manageable and enjoyable to sail even for those who prioritize motor cruising. The modern, efficient systems allow quick, easy sail deployment, making sailing nearly as simple as handling fenders.

Conclusion

The Nordhavn 56 MS delivers an appealing combination of Nordhavn’s renowned durability, motor power, and the flexibility of sailing. This motorsailer is ideal for those looking to extend their cruising range, enhance fuel efficiency, and have a reliable backup propulsion method—all while enjoying a quality, well-crafted interior."

Acting in the style of a number of well-known North European yacht builders, the company has provided for this expensive yacht only two cabins (but very spacious). But what is most surprising about this yacht is that it is the largest of all the boats up to 40 feet long.
With its large interior space and high quality finish, the Nordship 360 DS has very good running characteristics.

111
Period of manufacture
from 2018",https://itboat.com/models/8329-spirit-111,"Spirit 111 Overview

The Spirit 111 project by the British builder of luxury wooden yachts promises to be the best in several categories. It is the largest single-mast wooden yacht, and the most environmentally friendly. Apart from that, it has a unique style.

The exterior of the Spirit 111 looks classic, with a low freeboard and impressive overhangs. The yacht is full of surprises, by the way. The elegant vessel, designed by Sean McMillan, the founder of the yard, has a carbon range and sports sailing equipment. 

There are few right angles in the interior from Rhoades Young - all lines are rounded and flowing into each other. The interior might look simple, but only at first glance. Later, you will find out that the sofa in the salon is handcrafted from 1.2 km of small walnut panels. There are no light switches and door handles - everything opens and turns with the help of sensors. The trim panels are lined up so that the wood fibres are always vertical. There might be no TV or other entertainment on the boat. Just a little music. Or, on the contrary, the latest entertainment system if the owners decide so. In any circumstances, the Spirit 111 is ready to receive up to eight guests.

Conceived as a cruise racing yacht, Spirit 111 has an unlimited cruising area. It depends on whether the owners want to spend time in coastal racing with their peers or prefer long travels. Three BMW i3 batteries promise enough power for even small journeys. It's easy to recharge them by turning the propeller while sailing. The sails of the OneSails 4T40 have sensors, which makes the adjustment easier."

Period of manufacture
from 2016",https://itboat.com/models/8337-spirit-50cr,"Spirit 50CR Overview

The Spirit 50CR, launched by Spirit Yachts at the Southampton Boat Show 2019, embodies the perfect blend of modern engineering and classic design. Built in Ipswich, UK, Spirit Yachts is renowned for creating traditional yachts with a contemporary twist. The 50CR stands out with its beautiful woodwork and sustainable materials, making it a true masterpiece in the yachting world.

Design and Exterior

The Spirit 50CR features a carbon mast and boom, coupled with a furling Genoa, emphasizing its modern performance capabilities. The deck is not made of traditional teak but of Lignia, a UK-manufactured material derived from softwood, infused with resin, and treated with heat and pressure. This makes it harder than teak and potentially longer-lasting, offering a sustainable alternative without compromising on aesthetics.

The yacht's exterior showcases meticulous craftsmanship, with all lines led back to the cockpit for easy handling. Notable details include the Spirit Yachts logo inlaid into the cockpit sole and a 42-inch wheel, all contributing to the yacht's classic charm.

Interior Layout

Stepping below deck, the Spirit 50CR reveals a traditional yet luxurious layout. To starboard, a well-appointed galley and small seating area provide functional and comfortable spaces. On the port side, a U-shaped saloon seating area with a table offers a cozy spot for dining and relaxation. The interior is adorned with polished stainless steel portholes that open for ventilation and flush-fitting deckhead hatches, adding to the yacht's elegant ambiance.

The forward owner's cabin features exquisite joinery and an en-suite head, showcasing Spirit Yachts' attention to detail and craftsmanship. Moving aft through the saloon, the layout includes quarter berths on the starboard side and a double berth on the port side, ensuring ample sleeping accommodation for extended voyages.

Sailing and Comfort

The Spirit 50CR is designed for both beauty and functionality. The traditional navigation station provides a dedicated space for paper charts and electronics, essential for serious offshore cruising. The secure sea berths are built for comfort and safety, making the yacht suitable for long passages. The port aft cabin includes a stylish chest of drawers and a small wardrobe with a porthole for ventilation, enhancing onboard living comfort.

Conclusion

The Spirit 50CR by Spirit Yachts is a stunning yacht that successfully marries traditional aesthetics with modern performance. Its sustainable materials, meticulous craftsmanship, and thoughtful design make it a standout choice for those who appreciate elegance and functionality in a classic yacht. Whether you prefer traditional or modern boats, the Spirit 50CR is sure to impress with its timeless beauty and superior sailing capabilities."

The Spirit 70 is an elegant and classic sailing yacht, masterfully blending timeless design with modern technology. Known for their exquisite craftsmanship, Spirit Yachts are custom-built to the exact specifications of their owners, and Spirit 70 is no exception. The yacht is a testament to both beauty and performance, featuring modern sailing systems concealed beneath its classic, vintage aesthetic.

Exterior and Deck Layout

The exterior of the Spirit 70 boasts beautiful woodwork, clean lines, and a sleek design reminiscent of classic yachts from the 1960s. The deck is adorned with finely crafted details, and modern sailing equipment like Brooks and Gatehouse multifunction displays, hydraulic rig controls, and carbon fiber spars are discreetly hidden under traditional covers. The yacht features a spacious cockpit with a carbon fiber table for dining and lounging. Forward, there is ample space for a tender, which is easily lifted by the rig. The bow houses a roller furling system, ensuring efficient and easy sail management. The deck and cockpit provide an ideal mix of functionality and elegance.

Interior Design

Stepping into the interior of the Spirit 70 is like stepping back in time to the glamorous 1950s and 60s. The rich wood paneling, cozy saloon, and classic styling evoke a sense of nostalgia, yet the yacht is equipped with modern amenities such as air conditioning, making it as comfortable as it is stylish. The saloon is warm and inviting, perfect for relaxing after a day of sailing. A spacious navigation station adds to the classic aesthetic while incorporating state-of-the-art technology.

Cabins and Accommodations

The Spirit 70 is equipped with a VIP guest cabin, crew quarters, and an owner's cabin at the stern. The VIP guest cabin, located forward, features a double bed and an en-suite that is shared with the crew cabin. The crew quarters, located near the bow, can house up to two crew members, providing them with their own sleeping space and access from the deck.

The owner’s cabin is located aft and features a large double bed, a seating area, a desk, and an en-suite wet room. Despite the boat's performance-oriented design, the cabins are comfortable and elegant, offering guests a luxurious sailing experience.

Performance and Sailing

Though the Spirit 70 exudes classic beauty, it is built for performance. Equipped with carbon fiber spars, rod rigging, and a powerful sail plan, it delivers exceptional sailing performance. With slab reefing for the mainsail and a spinnaker for downwind runs, the Spirit 70 is built for speed while maintaining stability and control. The 110-horsepower Yanmar engine provides ample power when sailing isn’t possible, and the hydraulic systems simplify sail management.

Conclusion

The Spirit 70 is a yacht for purists who value classic design, superb craftsmanship, and exceptional sailing performance. It perfectly balances vintage aesthetics with modern conveniences, offering both comfort and style. This yacht is ideal for owners seeking a luxurious, custom-built sailing experience with a focus on tradition and elegance."

The Spirit 52 is a very successful shipyard project. With a displacement of only 8 tons (very little for a luxurious 50ft boat!) it is the perfect combination of racing performance and a superb level of comfort and elegance that is already the hallmark of Spirit Yachts. The small wet surface and the very high energy level make this yacht a speed cruiser: on full courses, the 52nd achieves a speed of 16 knots and on sharp courses, 9-10 knots.
Inside, the yacht can be finished in a classic or contemporary style, but the main thing remains the same in any case: it is two spacious cabins in the bow and stern and a large comfortable salon in between.

Sketches of the future model X4⁶ were presented in Dusseldorf in January 2018, and the first hull went down in August of the same year. The third Pure-X model from the Danish shipyard's X4⁶номинирована range was launched at Yacht «of the Year in» Europe in 2019.

Exterior and Interior Design

Unlike other modern yachts, the hull of X4⁶ provides speed on any course and in any weather. Powerful sailing arms are borrowed from the perfomance line with a geek-boat epaulet in cockpit flora and optional carbon mast. Added a jib-automatic, optional twist in the geek, teak coating in the cockpit as standard, bow thruster, optional electric winches and other elements of family boats.

Scandinavian oak with extensive natural light provides a sense of space in the rooms. The galley is made in an L-shape, which allows you to expand the dining area and add a sofa opposite without sacrificing an assault table.

Comfort on board

In the three-stateroom standard version, the left aft cabin can be ordered with separate beds. Unheard of luxury - two bathrooms with showers! One, of course, in the forward cabin. The cockpit looks ascetic, and a folding table says about the cruising nature of the boat. But there is no bimini and the sprayhood is optional - there is not much sun in Denmark!

Features

Sailing yacht X4⁶ for an experienced yachtsman with a sporting past who has built a family. The sporting elements are next to cruising facilities and the latest developments. A modern Yanmar common rail diesel and a folding screw are installed, the handwheels are self-contained, the cable is composite and there are three shelves of paint on the mast. Well and the famous hull with a steel «spider» at the base.

Swimming area

The shipyard's reputation with 40 years of history guarantees: for X4⁶ all destinations are open."

The XP 44 is the newest model in the XPerformance family: it was not available to dealers until early summer 2012. It replaced the 43rd model in the range, which had lasted in production for nine years. The public interest in the 44th was so great that 22 boats were ordered by customers only on the basis of drawings and announcements - before the appearance of a live yacht at «exhibitions» or from dealers. She has also served as a base for creation of the model Xr 38 - she as a whole repeats the general lines of the 44th, but has no separate sailing locker inside the bow.

The Xr 44 has excellent sailing characteristics with a score that is more advantageous than that of a number of serious competitors - for example, the Swan 45 or Farr 45 - with almost nothing inferior to them either on full or sharp courses. All this has led to her being nominated for Yacht of the Year in 2012."

By creating cruising models. Hs 45 иHs 42X-Yachts has gained some experience and insight into where to go next. Since her yachts have never been cheap, the bet was on a wealthier client. This required entering a new 50-foot size niche. The new large boat meets the requirements of the most demanding connoisseurs of long distance sailing - it has a spacious and light interior, excellent noise insulation and excellent build quality: nothing crackles or creaks while sailing. The possible layout versions offer both a pure houseboat version as well as a version with a cabin for an in-house bosunsman.
The acuity of an aviator is a little bit lower, than models of a ruler Xr, but for long sailings it is not so important.

Created by Bavaria in collaboration with Italian specialists from Cossutti Yacht Design, this cruising sailboat with a Mediterranean cockpit is an extension of the C-Yacht range and will be presented for the first time at the Booth Düsseldorf in January 2020.

Exterior and interior design

The main role in shaping the character of the boat was played by the protrusions in the hull in the waterline area aft (so-called «cheekbones») and the V-shaped bow. This combination of cheekbones had a positive effect on the boat's sailing characteristics, making it both more sensitive and more stable, and allowed for a noticeable increase in interior volume. Aft cheekbones «increase» the length of the waterline to 11.27 meters. The V-shaped nose narrows to the waterline. This shape compensates for the wide stern, reducing the differential at the heel. This allows you to walk safely on the boat, even in case of excitement.

Comfort on board


The cabins are located forward and aft of the boat. Depending on the layout, there may be two or three cabins. The improved hull shape makes the cabins more spacious. In the forward cabin, for example, a two-metre bed can be placed quietly.

The number of bathrooms does not depend on the number of cabins. If the owner wishes, they can be one or two.

Features

On deck C42 there is unusually much room for a sailboat of this size. This was also achieved with a full wooden deck along the sides and at the bow. In the cockpit, ergonomic benches in the shape of Latin L also take up no extra space.

The weight of the keel at 2700 kg and the total weight of the sailboat at 9600 kg is 28%.

In addition to the mainsail and a self-tipping jib with a total area of more than 100 square meters, the C42»wardrobe«will have a Code Zero of 85 square meters and a gennaker of 140 square meters.

The Beneteau First 44 is a highly anticipated yacht in the sailing world, bridging the gap between the 36 and the 53 models. This cruiser-racer embodies 40 years of tradition and innovation, designed for sailors seeking exceptional performance and comfort for family vacations.

Design and Features

Designed by Roberto Biscontini for naval architecture and Lorenzo Argento for exterior and interior design, the First 44 showcases several innovations. The mast is positioned further aft, increasing the head sail area and enhancing performance, particularly in the light winds typical of the Mediterranean. This setup makes the yacht more responsive and agile, providing an edge in racing.

The cockpit layout varies between the cruising and performance versions. The cruising version features two winches next to the helm for easy access, while the performance version optimizes the winch positions for crew efficiency. The mainsail trimming also differs, with a less obtrusive setup in the cruising version and a German-style mainsail sheet with a traveler in the performance version.

The yacht includes a teak deck for elegance in the cruising version and a non-slip surface for the performance version. A notable feature is the tender garage at the stern, which can accommodate a 2.10-meter dinghy, leaving the coach roof free for sunbathing.

Interior

Lorenzo Argento's interior design maximizes space and style. The First 44 offers a traditional three-cabin layout with two heads, one of which is notably spacious. The master cabin's position aft allows for a unique dinette arrangement with front seating and a transverse table.

The yacht's interior features a mix of white lacquered surfaces, light woods, and fine fabrics, creating a bright and welcoming environment. The aft beam provides ample space, and the broad windows offer a daylight effect inside. The design includes a minimalist chart table, enhancing the overall aesthetic.

Performance

The Beneteau First 44 excels in performance, offering a streamlined hull, generous sail plan, and high stern over the water. It is designed for a sailing enthusiast who appreciates a responsive helm and the thrill of speed.

The performance version includes a carbon mast and other enhancements for maximum racing capability. The yacht's ability to quickly switch tacks with minimal speed loss highlights its efficiency and performance-oriented design. The cruising version, optimized for a smaller crew, still offers excellent handling and maneuverability.

Conclusion

The Beneteau First 44 is a brilliant new addition to the First range, combining the best elements of its predecessors with modern innovations. Whether for competitive racing or leisurely cruising with family, this yacht delivers exceptional performance, style, and comfort, embodying the enduring legacy of the Beneteau brand."

The Beneteau Oceanis 34.1 is designed to deliver exceptional holidays even in the charter version. With a focus on livability and performance, this small sailing yacht promises to translate the cruising values of its larger siblings into a more compact vessel.

Hull Design

The hull of the Oceanis 34.1, designed by Mark Lombard, features a chine that runs from stern to bow, creating a more voluminous upper section while maintaining a lean lower profile. This design enhances performance by providing larger interiors and more powerful bow sections for reduced pitching upwind. The absence of an overly cruising roll bar and the addition of a wider mainsail area with a lower boom position make handling the mainsail easier.

Cockpit and Deck

The design includes widely swept-back spreaders and chain plates moved further aft, eliminating the backstay and freeing up space in the cockpit. The cockpit features a table that can accommodate six people and long seats for relaxation. Under the port bench is a large locker, while the starboard side is left open for better air circulation in the guest cabin. Safety is enhanced by the smart placement of the life raft at the stern, making it easy to handle in an emergency.

Interior Layout

The interior of the Oceanis 34.1, designed by Nauta Design, offers two layout options: a two-cabin or three-cabin version, both with a single functional head. The galley, located to starboard, has an intimate L layout, while the dinette features a central table with folding doors to accommodate up to six people. A small folding chart table frees up space for an additional berth, ideal for charter use. The owner’s cabin at the bow includes a deep V-berth, a wardrobe, and double shelves for personal storage.

Performance

Despite its size, the Oceanis 34.1 offers performance features typically found on larger boats. It includes a performance package (First Line) with a 39% increased sail area, a square-top mainsail with a German sheet, and a Genoa with a furling flat deck. Asymmetrical sails such as Code Zeros and gennakers can be attached to the bow sprit for enhanced sailing capabilities.

Conclusion

The Beneteau Oceanis 34.1 stands out by offering the strengths and solutions of larger boats in a more compact design. It is in line with modern market demands, providing the possibility of experiencing a dream vacation even on a small boat. With its innovative design, enhanced performance, and thoughtful layout, the Oceanis 34.1 ensures an exceptional sailing experience."

The Beneteau Oceanis 40.1 introduces a fresh design in the mid-size sailing yacht range, combining innovative features, ease of handling, and abundant space for a 40-foot boat. With flexible layout options and optimized for comfortable cruising, the Oceanis 40.1 is ideal for both weekend getaways and extended stays.

Deck and Exterior Features: Innovation Meets Functionality

The Oceanis 40.1 comes equipped with a spacious bathing platform that, with the touch of a button, lifts to form a flush transom, creating more deck space when at anchor. The dual helm design allows for clear visibility and ease of maneuvering, while folding footrests ensure comfort while the boat heels on a tack. Winches and controls are conveniently located near the helms, reducing the need to reach over passengers, making solo or shorthanded sailing straightforward.

For sail configurations, the Oceanis 40.1 offers in-mast furling for the mainsail, with slab reefing available as an option. The roller furling genoa and optional self-tacking jib make it a versatile choice for various sailing preferences. Additionally, flush deck hatches prevent any snagging on deck and maintain a clean, streamlined appearance.

Cockpit and Social Spaces: A Design for Gathering

The cockpit is designed for relaxation and socializing, with L-shaped seating and a fold-out table that allows for easy access to refreshments and ample seating for dining. An icebox is integrated for keeping drinks cool, and the dedicated space for a life raft under the seat ensures easy access in emergencies. The cockpit layout prioritizes guest comfort and accessibility without interference from sailing controls, making it ideal for hosting friends and family.

Interior: Spacious and Light-Filled with Elegant Finish Options

The interior of the Oceanis 40.1 feels open and airy, thanks to a light oak finish option (with walnut available for a traditional look) and well-placed windows and hatches. The large seating area in the saloon allows for comfortable dining, with a navigation station tucked off to the side for functionality without intruding on social space. A thoughtfully placed handrail system adds safety for moving around the boat at sea.

The galley, located opposite the seating area, features dual-purpose storage solutions, including a combination top-loading and front-opening fridge, which allows easy access at anchor or under way. The gimballed oven ensures stable cooking on the move, while plenty of storage keeps the space organized.

Accommodations: Flexible Layouts for Various Needs

The Oceanis 40.1 offers multiple cabin configurations, including a three-cabin, one-head layout or an option for two heads. The forward master cabin impresses with its generous size, featuring a double bed and ample storage, including hanging lockers and under-bed compartments. This setup creates a comfortable retreat, especially suited for long-term stays on board. For additional privacy, an en-suite head can be added to the master, creating a convenient layout for couples or families.

Aft, two guest cabins offer cozy accommodations with double beds, storage, and windows for natural light and ventilation. The three-cabin configuration optimizes space for families or guests, while the two-head option further enhances comfort, ensuring everyone has access to private facilities.

Performance and Engine: Reliable Power for Cruising

The Beneteau Oceanis 40.1 is equipped with a 45-horsepower Yanmar engine, offering an economical cruising speed of around 8 knots under power, ideal for navigating marinas and tight spaces. While the emphasis is on its sailing capabilities, this engine provides reliable auxiliary power for a range of conditions, making it an efficient cruiser.

Conclusion

The Beneteau Oceanis 40.1 combines spacious interiors, thoughtful deck layouts, and modern sailing technology to create a versatile and enjoyable cruiser."

The model, which was expected for over 10 years, First Yacht 53 made its debut in Cannes in September 2019.

Exterior and interior design...

The design of the flagship of the First line is entrusted to Italian with 20 years of experience in the «America»'s Cup, Roberto Biscontini. The deck and interior was designed by Lorenzo Argento. More than two years of work culminated in the creation of a boat that combined speed, comfort and elegance. Externally the hull looks flawless, but in the interior there is a conflict of concepts. The interior seems to be overloaded: a large galley narrows down the lounge and the right sofa has a nightstand - tight for a 17-meter yacht.

Amenities on board

The creators thought it was not necessary to place a large crew on a cruising and racing yacht. There are three cabins in the standard configuration with the possibility to add a bow for the captain. In the master suite there is a separate shower and bathroom in the bow, one or two bathrooms can be ordered for the guest cabins. The open and spacious cockpit can become a solarium and dining area or remain as open working space for the crew. After the models are overloaded with tables-sofas, such a spacious space looks even attractive.

Features .

The 40-year history of the Beneteau First line is rich with glorious pages written by Bruce Farr, Briand Design and Juan K. The 53rd model opens a new section, as it does not look like its predecessors. Born after testing 25 hulls, the new model will delight racers and cruisers alike. Optional carbon fiber mast (one meter above standard) and 3-meter draft. And travelers can add a table to the cockpit and other amenities.

Swimming area

Fuel volumes (400l) for 110 hp engine and water (720l) are similar to those of the «big four». But the First Yacht 53 surpasses them in weight (only 15900 kg) and sailing - respectively, the horizons are expanding."

The smallest Oceanis boat from Beneteau was premiered at Boot Duesseldorf 2019.

Exterior and interior design.

The eighth model in the reincarnation of the famous cruise line, the Oceanis 30.1 continues the tradition of small Beneteau built in the 1990s with the popular Oceanis 321 (850 hulls sold). Now the bureau Finot-Conq has created another masterpiece.

Externally, the mini-cruiser looks very modern. The cheekbone from bow to stern gives dynamics and allows for a 40 cm extension of the interior space.

Amenities on board

The interior of Oceanis 30.1 is designed by Nauta Design, which has been working with the yard since 2005. Thanks to the light finish, the impressive 1.95 in the pillowcase and the excellent access to light, the typical two-cabin layout does not look trivial.

The largest boat width of 2.99 m is admirable: inside it is really free. The folding table can accommodate 4 people, while cooking can be done in the most spacious galley in the class. After dinner, the owners will relax in the forward cabin on two-metre-long sunbeds. The size of the shower cabin is also impressive.

Features .

Several versions of Oceanis 30.1 are available to the customer: with fixed keel, the draft will be 1.88 m; with reduced draft, 1.30 m. Extendable and lifting keel versions are available. Rumple control or two steering wheels can be ordered. In the latter case, the cockpit can be equipped with a folding table.

To replace the highly successful Oceanis 45, Beneteau's world production leader in 2019 introduced a new «blockbuster» - Oceanis 46.1. The model is recognized as «Yacht of the Year» in Düsseldorf.

Exterior and Interior Design

The duo of Oceanis 46.1 is familiar: Pascal Conk is in charge of the hull and Nauta designs the interior. The creators have retained most of the elements that made the 45 a success, complementing them with new solutions. Immediately noticeable cheekbones along the hull, a bowsprit, spread around the edges of the backstaps, sunbathing areas on the roof of the cabin and the absence of winches and frame gigachots. And the boat became 1 meter longer.

Amenities on board

Oceanis 46.1 all about amenities. It seems that you can sit down/ lie down anywhere to eat/sunbathe. You can also very conveniently descend into bathing water from the platform. Rest is also very comfortable in the spacious forward cabin, and the cockpit can accommodate 8 people. Different configurations offer a different set of cabins, bathrooms and galley accommodation. The sofas have been donated with a navigating table.

Features

First of all, this speed: more than 10 knots sharp and 15 full courses are impressive. Two rudder pens are responsible for controllability, and in a special configuration the elongated mast and falshkil will add numbers to the camp. The yacht is also equipped with many «chips».

Swimming area

Traditionally these boats are certified as category «A», but do you want to go far with all these amenities? In a beautiful sunny bay it's not bad enough."

The yacht was presented by the Seascape shipyard in 2011. After Beneteau bought the Slovenian shipyard in 2018, the boat was tested, improved and included in the First line. By this time she has won many awards, including the Adriatic Yacht of the Year and titles from Sailing World and Sail Magazine.

Exterior and Interior Design

Designed by Sam Manuard and Gigodesign, the First 27 looks like an ocean Mini6.5. And it's no surprise, because the designer and creators of the Seascape shipyard were former Mini-Transat members. But in the cheekbone hull with open wide cockpit some conveniences are hidden, with permission to say.


Amenities on board

The First 27 provides accommodation for four people on a short cruise. Two sun loungers are placed in the bow and two on the sides along the cockpit. The salon has a folding table on a centreboard and a bathroom. There is a niche even for the fridge.

Features

Carbon rangout with powerful sailing arms is borrowed from sports prototypes and accelerates the light hull to double-digit numbers of speed. For maneuvering, the marina is equipped with an outboard petrol or electric engine, which sails into a niche under the cockpit.


Swimming area

According to the manufacturer, the First 27 is able to withstand storms up to 8 points. Of course, these are extremes, and it's better to avoid them. The First 27 trailer will bring a lot of joy to coastal racing enthusiasts at sea or on the lake. Fortunately, the class calendar in Europe is extensive."

The smallest boat of the French giant Beneteau First 14 debuted under the Seascape brand in Dusseldorf in 2018. In the same year Beneteau buys the Slovenian shipyard Seascape, and the dinghy designed by Samuel Manard enters the Beneteau First range. A year later, the model was voted Yacht of the Year by American Sail Magazine.

Exterior and Interior Design

The design of the boat uses a number of curious solutions. The First 14 can be either «single»or «double», interesting for beginners, experienced yachtsmen or family crews. Accordingly, it can only sail under the mainsail or under all three sails, and moving the centreboard forward and aft (single or twin) helps stabilise the boat.

Amenities on board

The modern hull design with smooth lines inside allows the crew to sit comfortably on board and enjoy the high speeds that the dinghy is developing.

Features .

This isn't the first dinghy dinghy ever. In the early 1980s, the» Beneteau Wizz 4.4 m «double was built (over 2000 hulls built). The Wizz was in many ways revolutionary, and now, 40 years later, the First 14 from Beneteau is again surprising. Here is a stacker truck, two centreboards, 64 kg weight and the possibility to transport on the roof of the car.

Swimming area

The Shuttlebot is certified for navigating in sea bays, rivers, large lakes where the wind force does not exceed 6 points. In practice, this means that with the First 14 you can spend interesting time literally on the nearest water body."

The Contest 50CS offers a distinct blend of luxury and performance, making it a notable addition to the Contest Yachts lineup.

Sailing Experience

The Contest 50CS is equipped with a Helix North Sails Code Zero, which can be easily managed single-handedly with a powered pad eye system. This setup is particularly beneficial for light wind conditions, allowing the yacht to maintain good speed and sailing performance. In light winds of around 5 to 6 knots, the yacht can match or exceed true wind speeds, achieving up to 7.5 knots apparent wind and 5.5 knots through the water. This makes the 50CS an excellent choice for sailing in areas with light winds, ensuring enjoyable sailing without resorting to the motor.

Deck and Cockpit Layout

The deck is fitted with STC composite decking, providing a sleek and modern look while being an environmentally friendly alternative to teak. One significant difference from the 49CS is the absence of a tender garage, due to the aft owner's cabin layout. This design raises the aft deck area, providing more headroom below.

The cockpit is described as a hybrid setup, combining the advantages of a center cockpit cruiser with the benefits of sailing from an outboard position. This results in a deep, protected central cockpit with easy access to sailing controls and a spacious layout for comfort and safety.

Interior

The interior of the Contest 50CS is beautifully designed, with an emphasis on natural light and spaciousness. The main difference from the 49CS is the massive aft owner's suite, which offers about 7 feet of headroom and excellent ventilation. The suite includes a large head and shower area and walk-in access to the engine room.

Moving forward, the layout features a VIP cabin and a bunk cabin instead of the aft storage area found in the 49CS. These cabins share a head and separate shower compartment, offering comfort and privacy for guests.

Key Features
Helix North Sails Code Zero: Allows for easy handling and optimal performance in light wind conditions.
STC Composite Decking: Provides a modern, sleek look and is an environmentally friendly alternative to teak.
Hybrid Cockpit Setup: Combines the benefits of a center cockpit with the functionality of an outboard helm position.
Spacious Aft Owner's Suite: Offers significant headroom, excellent ventilation, and a large ensuite head and shower area.
VIP and Bunk Cabins: Provide comfortable accommodation for guests, with shared head and shower facilities.
Natural Light and Ventilation: The design prioritizes ample natural light and ventilation throughout the yacht, enhancing the onboard living experience.
Conclusion

The Contest 50CS stands out as a luxury cruiser that offers both comfort and performance. Its ability to sail efficiently in light winds, combined with a spacious and well-thought-out interior, makes it a compelling choice for discerning sailors. Whether enjoying a leisurely sail in the Mediterranean or cruising in other light wind areas, the Contest 50CS delivers a remarkable sailing experience."

Exterior and interior design

This model is referred to at the shipyard as none other than «55 feet of beauty».

In terms of design, the Contest 55CS takes a lot from her older sisters, the 26m Contest 85CS and the 21m Contest 67CS. The superstructure roof flows smoothly into the spacious cockpit with two steering wheels. And inside, despite its modest size, this boat offers superyacht-level comfort and quality finishes. At the same time, the Contest 55CS remains a practical and seaworthy bluewater cruiser.

Thanks to a wide range of options this model is a true chameleon, which depending on the wishes of the future owner is he either tender or sloop, with a carbon or aluminum spars, with in-mast furling mainsail or traditional system grooving. The layout of the staterooms can also be customized.

The Contest 55CS designers tried to make her as roomy as possible, but they didn't forget about safety. Ergonomic handrails and ledges on the furniture are available to grasp the yacht in case of a rocking motion.

Onboard comforts

The increased number of portholes and the skylights in all three cabins and the saloon ensure that guests don't suffer from a lack of natural light. When the sun disappears, a designer lighting system replaces it until morning.

Features

The hull of the Lloyd's certified sailboat has carbon fibre reinforcements. This gives the boat good handling, lightweight yet strong.

The aft master stateroom provides panoramic views of the sea during anchorages - simply lower the hydraulic door of the tender garage which becomes a bathing platform.

Sailing region

On Contest 55CS you can go even to the circumnavigation.

«A variety of options will allow you to sail the boat anywhere and anytime and with the same pleasure where you want to stay at anchor. Safe, spacious and livable in all waters under all conditions - this is the Contest 55CS», the shipyard says."

Exterior and Interior Design

The elegant Contest 85CS lines showcase the benefits of the shipyard's long-term collaboration with world-class designers Judel/Vrolijk and Wetzels Brown Partners. The interiors in the basic version offer a classic contemporary style in light oak tones.

Amenities on board

The layout of the yacht provides options with 3-5 cabins and crew area in the bow or stern. A foldable transom turns into a swim platform and behind it a tender garage is hidden.

Features .

The Contest 85CS is already big enough to travel with great comfort, but still small enough to fit in any marina. The composite hull design of the yacht is Lloyds certified. The keel is made of stainless steel, the rudder feather is made of carbon. The set of sails, rigging and deck equipment depends on the client's preferences and his cruising or racing plans. The control posts are moved to the front of the cockpit, giving the rudder a more comfortable working position in the cold turbulent sea.

Swimming area

Naturally, a yacht like the Contest 85CS is available all over the world. The only limit for her is the inland waters with shallow depths (minimum draft of the yacht is 3.28m) and low bridges."

The Dufour 470, designed by Umberto Felci, impresses with its sleek lines and spacious deck layout, making it a standout in the cruising market. On the water, it demonstrates solid performance, particularly with the asymmetric sail, achieving speeds of 8.5 to 9 knots in 12 knots of true wind. The yacht's design includes options for a self-tacking jib or a genoa, catering to different sailing preferences. The flat coach roof and large cockpit area, enhanced by optional sunbeds and a grill, provide ample lounging space. The single rudder design and options like the German-led mainsheet or a performance version with a longer boom and different mainsheet configuration offer versatility for various sailing styles.

Deck and Rigging

The Dufour 470 features a user-friendly deck layout with a flat coach roof and spacious foredeck, facilitating easy movement and handling. The yacht is equipped with Elvstrom's new Echo sails, made entirely from recycled polyester, highlighting Dufour's commitment to sustainability. These sails, including the self-tacking jib, are crafted from recycled PET bottles, setting a new standard in eco-friendly sail production. The deck is designed for comfort and functionality, with ample space for sunbathing, lounging, and easy access to sail controls, making it ideal for both relaxed cruising and active sailing.

Interior and Accommodation

Inside, the Dufour 470 offers a luxurious and spacious environment. The three-cabin, two-head layout is the most popular, providing identical double cabins with plenty of beam, stowage, and large hull windows for natural light. The central saloon is open and inviting, with a large galley area that includes ample countertop space and drawer fridges. The absence of a dedicated navigation station is notable, with a switch panel serving the purpose instead. The forward cabin is particularly impressive, with split head and shower areas and a large, open sleeping area. For those opting for a charter version, the forward cabin can be divided into two separate cabins.

Popularity and Market

The Dufour 470 has quickly become a favorite in the cruising market, with over 200 units sold. This yacht is seeing a shift in ownership trends, with the majority now being sold to private owners rather than charter fleets. Its blend of performance, comfort, and innovative design, along with eco-friendly sail options, makes it a compelling choice for modern sailors looking for both luxury and sustainability in their cruising yacht. The Dufour 470's spacious layout, high-quality finishes, and excellent sailing capabilities ensure it stands out in its class."

Joining the Fountaine Pajot, the French brand Dufour has developed a strong activity with the 390 and 430 in Düsseldorf, leaving the Dufour 530 the role of the following debutant.

Exterior and interior design

Designer Umberto Felci faced an unusual challenge. His previous developments for the Grand Large and Performance lines got to get together into a sailboat. Subsequently, Dufour 530 got three editions: Easy, Ocean and Performance. Certainly, the difference between them is significant.

Easy is for beginners and charter,
Ocean - for the owner with plans for long trips,
Performance - for racing, is characterized by the organization of rigging, high mast, no table in the cockpit and more draft.

On the other hand, all configurations have an enclosed cockpit, clean deck, glazed superstructure, hull with cheekbone in the stern and generous layout of the saloon.

Comfort on board

The Dufour 530 offers four configurations: from three cabins with three bathrooms to seven cabins (4+3, including the bow). The galley is offset to the bow and is tight, but the salon and dining areas are spacious. The Ocean version of the master cabin in the bow features a separate spacious shower.

The cockpit has a special bimini. Under it, there is a grill, fridge and sink, it is possible to install a solarium in the stern between the steering posts. There is a bathing platform in the transom.

Features of Dufour 530

The Dufour 530 is heavier than the competitors due to its reinforced hull, which affects speed and upgrades reliability. However, the layouts might look strange, and price policy poses questions. But with so many versions and options, as Dufour 530 has, you can always find a solution.

Cruising area

Category A certified, this sailboat has a good fuel reserve of 440 litres for an engine of 75 hp (a 110 hp engine is also worth considering). The water tanks carry 680 litres of water."

The new model from the famous French debuted in 2018 at the show in La Grande-Motte. Immediately winning two regional awards, the Astrea 42 was named Catamaran of the Year in Düsseldorf in January 2019.

Exterior and interior

Behind Astrea 42 stands Berret Racoupeau, which designed the successful Lucia 40 and Saona 47. It is no wonder that Astrea 42 has a lot in common with them. There are brand-name fast lines, spacious saloon, cockpit and steering position. The latter is a Fountaine Pajot chip. Now the helm is not bored alone. You can join him in the double seat, allowing friends to relax next to him on a spacious platform with sofas for sunbathing.

Another find of the Astrea 42 is the optional aft bathing platform. Significantly increasing the rest space in the parking lot, the platform also helps to move between enclosures outside the cockpit.

Amenities on board

Astréa 42 is available in two versions, Maestro and Quatuor. In the first version, the right hull is fully owner-occupied and guests are accommodated in the left hull in two cabins. The Quatuor provides accommodation in four cabins with different configurations of sanitary zones.

Features .

Lighted by panoramic windows, the salon is suitable for communication and recreation. The U-shaped sofa and free passage to the cockpit, where, by the way, the grill is placed, guarantees a relaxed atmosphere even for a large company. Inside the hulls, the traditional double cabins have been turned into real hotel rooms - here, on the contrary, privacy and comfort reigns.

Features

As with previous models, the control post is located on the starboard hill, with schools and halyards for sailing. When choosing the option for family use, the owner will receive an impressive size apartment in the port float and two more guest cabins. The charter version has four cabins of 8.5 square each.

A spacious catamaran is a full-fledged home on the water and is suitable for those who are not ready to accept compromises on comfort when living under sail.

Exterior and interior design.

The designers of the Fountaine Pajot shipyard and the architectural firm Berret Racoupeau have made every effort for the success of this model. Alegria 67 is characterized by impressive volumes and the rigor of its lines. The interiors of Alegria 67 in an elegant urban style were created by Isabelle Racoupeau.


Amenities on board

The entrance to the large flybridge of Alegria 67, where the steering post is located, is accessible via safe steps. The main salon and cockpit are fully dedicated to rest and relaxation. It should be noted that the Jacuzzi with sea water is not yet very common on sailboats.

The shipyard has taken care of a variety of layouts so that each client can build a catamaran exactly to their needs. The charter version has up to 6 cabins planned. The owner's version offers more spacious spaces and a 22 sqm master suite. The location of the galley (in the saloon or on the lower level) is also the client's choice, as is the layout with the crew area.

Features

Ecology is part of the concept behind which Alegria 67 was created. Solar panels maximize the energy independence of the yacht. During the day at the berth, Alegria 67 is fully self-contained, receiving electricity from its own sources.

Sailing area

The catamaran is designed for long cruises and is certified for ocean navigation. The sediment of the catamaran is traditionally small - 170 cm and underlines its advantages in shallow waters."

The Grand Soleil 65LC is a stunning new design from Matteo Polli, built for both performance and long cruising.

Sailing Performance

The Grand Soleil 65LC is available in two versions: long cruise (LC) and performance. The LC version, with its raised coach roof, is designed for comfort and extended voyages. The boat features a v-shaped bow and narrow wetted surface area, which increases power as it heels. The mast has been brought aft, creating a balanced sail plan with a Genoa and mainsail of similar size.

Cockpit and Deck Layout

The cockpit of the 65LC is designed for both shorthanded sailing and comfort. The halyard winches are positioned at the mast base, making it easy to manage the sails with a small crew. The main sheet trimmer sits aft, with winches dedicated to the main sheet, while the head sail trimmer has a clear view forward. The deck features wide side decks and a Portuguese bridge, ensuring safe and easy movement around the boat. The foredeck includes a large seating area with a bench and substantial mooring gear.

Interior

The interior of the 65LC is designed for both luxury and practicality. The saloon features a raised area with standing horizon views and plenty of natural light. The layout allows for extensive tank space and additional machinery space. The engine room is located under the companionway, providing easy access to the generator and other equipment.

The master cabin, located forward, offers a spacious layout with a low berth and ample storage. The ensuite bathroom includes a separate shower compartment. The guest cabins are equally well-appointed, with the option for a fourth cabin that can serve as a crew cabin or additional guest space. The U-shaped galley is practical and well-equipped, with plenty of worktop space and storage.

Flybridge and Helm

The flybridge of the Grand Soleil 65LC features a central helm station with excellent visibility and easy access to controls. The helm is ergonomically designed, with a fully adjustable seat and a clean, unfussy layout. The flybridge also includes a dedicated sunbathing space and a spacious dinette, making it a perfect spot for relaxation and socializing.

Engine Room

The engine room is designed for easy maintenance and daily service checks. It houses a pair of Volvo Penta IPS 650 engines, each providing 480 horsepower, for a top speed of 28.2 knots. The cruising speed is most comfortable at around 20-23 knots. The engine room is well-laid out, with easy access to all sides of the engines, making daily service checks simple. Everything is clearly labeled for quick identification, and the air conditioning unit is working hard to keep the boat comfortable.

Conclusion

The Grand Soleil 65LC is a perfect blend of performance, luxury, and practicality. Whether you're looking for a comfortable long-distance cruiser or a performance-oriented yacht, the 65LC offers a versatile and well-thought-out design that caters to a wide range of sailing needs. This boat offers exceptional value for those looking for a high-quality, custom-built yacht."

The Grand Soleil 44 Performance, designed by Cantiere del Pardo and Matteo Polli with Nauta Design, achieves a perfect balance between interior layout and hull design. This elegant vessel promises both exceptional performance and luxurious comfort, making it a standout in the sailing world.

Design and Layout

The Grand Soleil 44 measures 14.35 meters in its standard configuration and 15.01 meters in its race version, with a maximum beam of 4.3 meters and a displacement of 9,000 kg. A key design feature is the mast position, set further back to optimize the sail plan and interior space. This unique setup enhances both the yacht's performance and its interior comfort, providing ample room for a spacious saloon and easy access to seating areas.

Interior Features

The interior of the Grand Soleil 44 is designed for comfort and functionality. It features two large aft cabins with double beds and ample storage, including a double-door wardrobe and under-bed compartments. The galley is well-equipped with a double sink, large fridge, and Corian countertops. The saloon offers a C-shaped sofa, an additional straight sofa, and a fixed dining table that comfortably seats eight. The forward master cabin is spacious, with a dedicated en-suite bathroom and separate shower, a true luxury for a 44-foot yacht.

Deck and Sailing Performance

On deck, the Grand Soleil 44 is tailored for racing with a race-specific layout that includes six winches, compared to four in the easy sailing version. The deck design allows for a clear distinction between the maneuvering cockpit and the guest area, typically seen on larger yachts. The wide side decks, deep benches, and optional sun pads provide both comfort and functionality. The sail plan includes options for different foresails, including an overlapping jib and a self-tacking jib track, making it adaptable to various sailing conditions.

Sailing Experience

The Grand Soleil 44 truly shines when its sails are up. With a 66 square meter mainsail and a Code 0, the yacht matches the wind speed effortlessly. The aft mast position reduces heeling and increases performance in light winds, ensuring better handling and responsiveness. The hull design, with its wide beam and narrow waterline, is optimized for Mediterranean conditions, making it ideal for both racing and cruising.

Conclusion

This go-anywhere cruiser showcases a modern hull shape with a wide beam carried far aft, enhancing both performance and onboard space. The yacht features a premium rig package, including a carbon mast, boom, and spreaders, complemented by a Code Zero sail for exceptional light wind performance.

Despite its 25-ton displacement, the Hallberg-Rassy 50 glides effortlessly through the water, even in light winds, often matching or exceeding true wind speeds. The deck layout is both functional and spacious, with wide side decks, a large flush foredeck, and ample cockpit space, making it ideal for long passages and comfortable cruising.

Sailing Performance

The Hallberg-Rassy 50 excels in various wind conditions, demonstrating impressive light wind performance. The beam carried far aft and the mast positioned further back contribute to its excellent balance and handling. Under sail, the yacht maintains good speed and stability, easily achieving seven knots in just eight knots of wind. The boat is equipped with a carbon in-mast furling mainsail and a vertically battened Code Zero, providing versatility and ease of handling. The integrated hydraulic systems for the halyards and the efficient rigging setup allow for smooth sail adjustments, making it a joy to sail even with a small crew.

Interior and Accommodation

The interior of the Hallberg-Rassy 50 is a blend of modern design and classic luxury, offering more space and light than previous models. The wide beam extends the living area, providing a large saloon with ample seating and a generous galley. The saloon features a comfortable dining area, a well-equipped navigation station, and plenty of storage.

The Hallberg-Rassy 40C expands the idea of what you can get from a 40 foot yacht. This model is an excellent compact boat for long distance cruising in a small company.

Exterior and interior design

The yacht is designed by Herman Frers. The exterior of the model is modern on the one hand and the other is a typical Hallberg-Rassy with its characteristic smooth silhouette lines and excellent seaworthiness.


Amenities on board

Hallberg-Rassy 40C has adopted much from the older sister Hallberg-Rassy 44 in terms of comfort and interior volume. The saloon, galley and aft cabin, as well as the cockpit, are almost identical to that of the 44C . You can choose between two versions of the galley - large or huge. In the second case, we get a larger working area, more storage space and, optionally, a dishwasher and microwave. The aft cabin has two options with separate beds or a large central cabin. Six hull portholes of the same size as the larger models provide interiors with natural light.

Features

The boat has two rudder pens, a well protected cockpit and a sail plan with the possibility of installing an automatic staysail. The integrated bowsprit allows to carry the gennaker. Hallberg-Rassy 40C can be ordered with a hard spray or hardtop. A bathing platform can be installed in the stern.

Swimming area

The cruiser is designed for serious ocean voyages and is well prepared for difficult weather conditions. The sediment of the boat is 1.92 m."

Recently the Swedes have been delighted with excellent novelties, while Hallberg-Rassy 57 has become a real blockbuster for 2019. В Dusseldorf the boat is nominated for «Yacht of the Year». But the best score is 10 orders in six months.

Interior and exterior design...

Designed by Frers, the 57th combines classic and modern. It's not just words - it all depends on the angle of view. When you look from nose to stern, you will notice a modern shtavnya and athletic bend of the stern. If you look into the transverse side, Hallberg-Rassy 57 is a typical «race». The movement of the portholes towards the stern makes it visually longer. The deck is completely flat, with the twist drum and windlass hidden underneath, like other gear. The forward cabin hatches are on the same plane as the deck - chic! The superstructure with extensive glazing, unlike other similar models, looks if not fast, it is very modern. There are also two rudder pens and a bathing platform.

Amenities on board

The first thing you will feel in the salon is the warmth of quality wood. Light oak, teak or mahogany are optionally available. There are two options, but it is the base cabin that attracts attention: a chic aft cabin, a galley to starboard and a spacious salon with «a captain»'s chair. Forward there are two more cabins.

Features

The first model 17.5m long by Hallberg-Rassy looks fresh. No doubt the 57th will break the stereotype of the Swedish shipyard as an old-fashioned one. Behind the helm a sailor and a young couple look equally advantageous.

Swimming area

Sediments 2.5m, waterline 16.7m, mast 27m, ton of water and a ton of fuel for 150 hp engine. What else do you need for your journey? Unless it's a good passat!"

Designed by Germán Frers, the Hallberg-Rassy 340 replaces the 342, which has been built for 13 years and sold in 328 copies. Although the 340th Hallberg-Rassy offers more volume, the price as promised by the manufacturer will remain the same.

Amenities on board

The spacious salon is equipped with two-meter sofas. The galley is away from the aisle and does not prevent you from entering the aft cabin. The master stateroom is equipped in the bow of the boat and has a 2 meter wide bed in the headboard, as well as storage cabinets. The aft cabin offers the occupants a sleeping space of 2x2 meters.

Features

The Hallberg-Rassy 340 has what is typically found on larger boats, including double helm and large saloon, but this is achieved at the cost of some compromises, such as a small galley and no navigating space. In addition, it is an excellent boat with a rich standard equipment, able to embody the most daring travel list. Another bonus is that the secondary price of this boat will be as high as a premium quality yacht. Two rudder pens, an integrated bowsprit and excellent speed qualities are included.

Exterior and Interior Design

Hallberg-Rassy 44 is designed by famous Germán Frers, famous for his works for such top shipyards as Nautor's Swan, Wally and others.

Amenities on board

The aft master suite is available with a central bed or two separate on board. Natural interior lighting is an important part of comfort.

Features

Like the other Hallberg-Rassy, the 44th model has a large and very well protected cockpit. The steering station is equipped with a chart plotter and a multifunction display. All working ends are hidden under the deck surface, the main ones can be controlled directly from the cockpit. Two steering pens make the boat easy to operate. The mast furling coat has vertical battens across the entire height and is not a shapeless triangle, as is often the case with this design, but has been shaped to a precise profile thanks to the Elvström FatFurl system.

The Hanse 510 introduces an innovative evolution to Hanse’s popular 508 model, blending refined design with modern enhancements for a versatile, spacious sailing experience. This yacht is packed with thoughtful details for comfort, ease of navigation, and seamless access, catering well to both owners who love to sail and those looking to charter.

Enhanced Cockpit and Access

A significant improvement over the 508 is the redesigned cockpit access. The Hanse 510 features a wider hydraulic platform that includes a stair system, facilitating smooth transitions between the cockpit and water access. Unlike previous models, the 510’s biminy has been moved to an outer position with a square frame, which greatly enhances ease of movement and access to the cockpit.

Spacious and Welcoming Interior

Inside, the Hanse 510 impresses with its warm, inviting atmosphere. Hanse opted for a darker floor complemented by a warm wood finish, giving the yacht a cozy, modern feel. The main saloon has an open design with increased headroom, creating a spacious, light-filled environment. The large, sturdy steps leading down to the saloon add to the sense of durability and stability.

The main control station, while notably minimalist, is efficiently designed. Instead of a traditional nav desk, this version consolidates key controls into an under-cabinet station, housing the VHF, fusion stereo, and control panel in a concealed but easily accessible location.

Flexible Cabin Configurations

This model is the five-cabin version, suitable for charters and families. The forward cabin, redesigned to feel roomier than the 460, has ample space and quality finishes, which makes it suitable for adults as well as children. Additionally, the forward bunk cabins feel wider, providing extra room for guests.

Galley and Storage

The galley layout incorporates several practical elements, such as a fridge and drawer setup reminiscent of the 460. Cupboards have returned to the design, offering needed storage space, and come with a protective lip for added security during sailing. There is also a range of customizable finishes, from darker wood options to a bright white top, allowing owners to tailor the interior aesthetics to their preference.

Concerns and Room for Improvement

While the Hanse 510 showcases many enhancements, a few areas may require further testing under sail. For instance, the anchor locker has been adjusted with a sloped design, which may lead to chain buildup. This could necessitate occasional clearing—an inconvenience on a yacht that prides itself on single-handed sailing functionality.

Conclusion

The Hanse 510 demonstrates Hanse’s dedication to combining function with modern comfort, offering an enhanced layout and a warm, adaptable interior. With various configurations and improved accessibility, the Hanse 510 is set to meet the demands of both charter and private use. Additional testing at sea will further reveal its performance, but the initial impression is promising for this innovative sailing yacht."

Made its debut in Cannes in autumn 2016, the Hanse 588 replaced the 575. In 2018 the American Sail Magazine recognized the 588 as «Yacht of the Year».

Exterior and Interior Design

Based on customer feedback, the shipyard has continued to improve the model. Inheriting the hull of Judel/Vrolijk's 575, the Hanse 588 became heavier and more sailable. Optionally, a rigid T-Top roof was added to the cockpit. Salon and layout has been completely changed. The galley has been moved to the right and the dining area to the left and an additional sofa has been added. At the same time, the navigation table has been saved thanks to an interesting solution of the folding back of the sofa. The height of the cushion and the size of the portholes have been increased, making the interior even lighter and more spacious.

Comfort on board.

The basic 4-cabin version with side cabin, U-shaped galley and master cabin in the bow can be converted into a 5-cabin charter cabin with«island»sink, making it easy to move in the salon. But the main «feature of the» model is additional noise insulation of the owner's cabin. Configuration of the cockpit with telescopic tables is usual, but the dinghy garage and bathing platform have increased.

Features

Hanse Yachts continues to pamper the consumer with interesting engineering solutions and many options. For example, the bathroom and shower room can be used together. Or here are three variants of rainfall and the shape of the falsetto - a rarity even for the grandees of mass production. There are more and more in the boat and everything is wider. But the interior is too full of right angles.

Swimming area

Certified in category A, the Hanse 588 is designed for comfortable cruising. It is equipped with 110 hp engine (150 hp - optional) and 520 liters of fuel. However, the water supply has been slightly reduced: 770 liters vs. 810 liters for the 575 model."

Exterior and interior design

The boat has received its exterior and architecture from the Judel / Vrolijk & Co studio, which has given it a modern look and good cruising performance. The interior spaces were taken care of by the yard's design department. There is plenty of natural light here and in the evening there are plenty of luminaires to create a cosy and pleasant atmosphere.

Despite the abundance of manholes, there is a place on the roof where sunbathing is possible. The Lower Deck is available with two or three cabins. In the first version, a large pantry for various uses takes up space at the stern.

Features

The deck is flat without protruding objects and with smooth corners. All wiring of the running rigging is tucked into the hoods and bolted. On the aesthetic side this is certainly a plus, but if one of the ends slips out, tucking it back in will be a big problem. Otherwise, the controls do not cause any special complaints and are placed conveniently for solo work.

Exterior and interior design

The Hanse 388 sailboat was launched in 2017 and is available simultaneously with 348, 418 and 548 models. Above the exterior of the boat with a Mediterranean cockpit worked the studio Judel/Vrolijk, and the interior spaces were decorated with its own design department.

The yacht is designed in a modern style with a special emphasis on functionality and comfort. At the same time the manufacturer has not forgotten about the sea qualities, offering a rather productive boat.

Amenities on board

The Germans have well planned the cockpit with comfortable sofas and a folding table, and the control posts have been installed closer to the stern. Thus, in good weather the owner-captain can freely communicate with the guests and control the boat simultaneously. Downstairs there is a large L-shaped kitchen, a cabin for eight people and a navigating table. A choice of two and three cabins is available.

Features .

The boat «is sharpened» for a small crew, one or two people can manage it. That makes it a good family cruiser. Also the version with three cabins is popular with charter companies.

The most compact cruising sailing yacht in the range with the Mediterranean Cockpit Hanse 315 was presented in 2015 and won the title of «European Boat of the Year. The interior»spaces are filled with natural light and are available in several colors.

Facilities on board.

In the standard package, the cockpit is equipped with a tiller, but optionally it can be replaced with two handwheels, which makes it comfortable to operate with any tack. Also in the second version, there is space for a table at the stern. The lower deck has a small L-shaped galley, two separate cabins, a dining area and a bathroom. There is also a good fuel reserve for 100 litres and a water tank for 250 litres.

Features

The boat is designed more for family yachting. In the basic set the 315 is equipped with an automatic staysail, maybe in some situations this will lead to a loss of speed, but there is no need to be distracted by the sails and it is easier to sail alone. However, if you wish, you can always choose other weapons and put the gene.

Swimming area

The Hanse 315 was the first production sailboat in its class to be CE certified in Category A (as opposed to even the larger 348) and can go out into the ocean. The boat comes with a 1.85 metre keel as standard. For shallow waters, an optional 1.37 metre keel is provided, but then it is not recommended to go further than the sea in this package."

Design and Features

The Jeanneau 350 features a twin wheel setup in the cockpit, a design previously seen on larger yachts.

Jeanneau has a rich history in the world of sailing, starting with the groundbreaking Sun Odyssey 51, which introduced new levels of habitability and layout flexibility. The Jeanneau Yachts 55 continues this legacy, embodying innovation both in its interior and deck design.

Design and Layout

The Jeanneau Yachts 55 stands out with a layout that revolutionizes space utilization. Designed by Philippe Briand for the nautical aspects and Andrew Winch for the interiors, the yacht features a third of its interior space dedicated to the owner, with a large forward cabin and en-suite bathroom. This layout offers a loft-like atmosphere, creating a spacious and open environment.

Interior Comfort

The main cabin boasts extensive storage, a large bed, and a bathroom that can be sectioned off with dual doors. The central cabins also offer high levels of autonomy with their own refrigerators and coffee machines. Additional cabins are situated aft, accessible from the cockpit, which is a unique feature that deviates from traditional layouts.

Innovative Cockpit

The cockpit of the Jeanneau Yachts 55 is designed to maximize space and ease of movement. It features expansive seating areas that can be converted into sunbathing spots, free from the interference of maneuvering lines. This layout facilitates a clear passage from the helm to the bow without obstacles, enhancing both safety and comfort.

Sailing and Maneuverability

Equipped with dual helm stations, the yacht allows comprehensive control from either side. The sail plan includes a furling mainsail and genoa, along with a self-tacking staysail, making it efficient even in challenging conditions. The boat's hull, designed by Philippe Briand, ensures balanced performance and agility.

Performance

Despite its luxurious and spacious design, the Jeanneau Yachts 55 maintains respectable sailing performance. In tests, it has demonstrated the ability to reach nearly 7 knots with a real wind speed of 10-11 knots, showcasing its efficiency and well-engineered hull.

Conclusion

The Jeanneau Yachts 55 carries forward the innovative spirit of its predecessors while introducing modern enhancements in both design and functionality. Its unique layout, high level of comfort, and solid performance make it a compelling choice for sailors seeking both luxury and efficiency.

This new model is set to inspire and possibly influence future yacht designs, much like the Sun Odyssey 51 did in its time. With its combination of tradition and modernity, the Jeanneau Yachts 55 is poised to become another iconic model in Jeanneau's illustrious lineup."

Sun Fast 3300 is a racing projectile for experienced yachtsmen, optimized for IRC racing for two. This boat is also suitable for racing alone or with a full crew and will be a tough competitor in coastal and offshore regattas.

Exterior and Interior Design

Having decided to replace the popular 11-year-old Sun Fast 3200, Jeanneau has made a small revolution. Guillaume Verdier, a guest designer (designed the IMOCA 60 class and America's Cup), designed the yacht together with Daniel Andrieu, native «architect» of Sun Fast brand. The experts christened the new boat with a «pocket rocket».

Facilities on board.

Below deck, Sun Fast 3300 offers basic amenities that, however, make life at sea more comfortable. Two double cabins aft, two berths in the saloon, a minimum galley and a bathroom in the bow of the boat - compared to some other «pure» cruisers this is almost a luxury.

Features

With its lightweight, powerful hull, two rudders and long keel, the Sun Fast 3300 combines speed and stability in all sea conditions. The Sun Fast 3300 is available with the 200 litre water ballast option, which consists of two independent tanks. A grotto with a rectangular top necessitated the presence of the backstraps, but Jeanneau made sure that operation was easy even for a minimum crew. The integrated bowsprit allows to carry the genaker, thanks to which the yacht glides and shows good speed.

Swimming area

It is a reliable yacht, which can be used both offshore and for active cruising off the coast, and, if you wish, go to the transatlantic."

The 410th Sun Odyssey from French Jeanneau was unveiled in autumn 2018 and has already won the titles of «Best Middle Size Cruiser» and «Yacht of the Year in Asia».

The exterior and interior design...

Designed by Marc Lombard and Piaton Yacht Design, the Sun Odyssey 410 looks modern. The reverse stem, cheekbone hull, longitudinal portholes and bowsprit give the boat a boost. But the real highlight of Sun Odyssey's ninth generation is the «walk-around deck», a recessed outer passage from the helm to the tank along the board, gradually rising to deck level. Thus, the cockpit forms a closed system where all rigging and winches are concentrated.

Comfort on board

The customer is offered a two- and three-bedroom configuration, the number of bathrooms can also be changed. Usually sacrificed in favor of household needs, the navigating table in this model is quite convenient. The salon has a new sofas and an excellent galley. The dining table will have to be folded for the passage to the bow cabin, which, by the way, pleasantly surprises with its size, due to the absence of overhanging shelves.

Features

The concept of the walk-around«deck» looks ambiguous. The walk-around deck will be flooded with water on the horses, and there will be no safe exit to the nose, to put it mildly, let alone a change of tack when the scooped water falls into the cockpit. Besides, the configuration of the running rigging to the winches has been changed, which has affected the external aesthetics. But it's a trifle when you see a modern boat on the move in good weather.

The region of sailing

Sun Odyssey 410 is certified in category «A»."

Exterior and interior design

Like other models, the Sun Odyssey 490 was designed by Philippe Brian (Hull) and Jean-Marc Pyaton (Interior). The cheekbone profile provides internal space with a small wet surface, which guarantees a good roll or under motor. What's more, the boat's speed performance has been improved by 10% lightening. The dry weight of 11.5 tonnes, achieved by using a balsa core in both the hull and superstructure, looks impressive against the competition.

In addition to the bowsprit, two rudder feathers, the main innovation of the model is the walk-around deck, i.e. the deepened outer passage along the sides from the helm to the tank, gradually rising to the deck level. Another highlight «of the» cockpit is the ability to deploy two sunbathing zones thanks to the transformation of the coamings.

Amenities on board

Among the proposed configurations of the basic is considered a 3-cabin version, where the bow cabin for the owner already resembles a small hotel room. There is a TV panel, shelves for books, cabinets and a spacious bathroom. In the salon a comfortable galley in front of the dining area with wide sofas attracts attention.

Sun Odyssey 440 was introduced in summer 2017 and won the Boot Dusseldorf «Yacht of the Year»title in January 2018. Later prizes from Cruising World magazine (USA) and a special prize Asia Boating Award were added.

Exterior and Interior Design

The partnership between Philippe Briand and «Jeano» has 45 models, where the Sun Odyssey 440 was one of the most successful. The designer confesses that he was inspired by the forms of scow ballers, popular in the early twentieth century. That is, the boat came out flat and full in the bow. At the stern, the main innovation is the walk-around deck, i.e. the deepened outer passage along the sides from the helm to the tank, gradually rising to the deck level.

The amenities on board

The full bow allowed for more space to be added to the owner's cabin and a wider range of layout options. The yard now offers four basic configurations from two to four cabins. At the same time, the salon is spacious and has everything you need in the home. Another feature «of the» model is the spacious lounge area for sunbathing, which unfolds in the cockpit.

Features

The title Most Innovative by Cruising World Magazine was awarded to the Sun Odyssey 440. There are many bold decisions in the boat, but their usefulness remains to be seen. The walk-around deck, for example, can be filled with water on a sharp course with a heel, and when you turn the sunbathing platform, you will find a winch sticking out at the helm. That is, Sun Odyssey 440 is the case when the test drive is not superfluous.

Sun Odyssey 440 is certified in category «A»."

The Lagoon 43 is a newly announced model from Lagoon, designed to enhance the features and functionality of its predecessor, the Lagoon 42. This new model aims to offer improved comfort, adaptability, and generous space for its users.

Key Features and Design

One of the standout features of the Lagoon 43 is its ease of movement. The boat is designed with a side access door and a flush cockpit and inside area, ensuring seamless movement throughout. This design choice enhances the overall user experience, making it easier to navigate the vessel.

The Lagoon 43 is highly adaptable, featuring several convertible elements.

This flexibility ensures that the boat can be easily configured to suit different needs and preferences.

The Lagoon 43 boasts generous space, particularly in its hulls. The volume has been increased to provide larger cabins. The owner’s cabin, for instance, has been redesigned with the bed positioned forward and the shower aft, reducing noise from the engine and increasing stability.

Interior and Exterior Enhancements

The interior of the Lagoon 43 has been thoughtfully designed to maximize comfort and usability. The owner’s cabin features a spacious head with a separate toilet and shower area, providing a luxurious feel. Additionally, there is a semi-saloon area at the front and a saloon area on top, enhancing the comfort and accessibility of the space.

Externally, the Lagoon 43 includes a forward cockpit saloon, a feature that distinguishes it from previous models. The boat also introduces the mast-forward design, first seen on the Lagoon 51, which provides more space in the saloon area and enhances the sailing experience.

Advanced Sailing Features

The Lagoon 43 incorporates advanced sailing features such as the Fing Bo system, available on models like the Lagoon 46 and 51. This system improves the sailing performance and handling of the vessel, making it easier and more enjoyable to sail.

Conclusion

The Lagoon 43, set to be available in early 2025, represents a significant advancement in the design and functionality of catamarans. With its focus on ease of movement, adaptability, and generous space, this new model promises to provide an exceptional sailing and living experience for its users."

Sunbathing areas are highlighted on the flybridge and at the bow. The Lower Deck is traditionally available in two versions, with three cabins (for private use) and four (charter version).

Features

The designers decided to move the mast closer to the center of the hull. This allowed to reduce the area of the mainsail, making it more obedient, and at the same time increase the stack. On the 46th, the manufacturer gave up the genoa, making it easier to work with the sails. The control post has been moved to the centre, but the view is a bit difficult and the optional cameras are not superfluous.

Region of sailing

The Lagoon 46 is certified for ocean access. Both the water desalter and 1040 litres of fuel reserve provide good autonomy. With this amount of fuel you can not just go to the marina, and in the absence of wind even go under the engine to the nearest islands."

The ClubSwan 43 is a versatile sailing yacht that seamlessly blends high-performance racing with comfortable cruising. Designed as the perfect crossover, this yacht caters to one-design sailing enthusiasts, families looking for a fast and fun cruiser, and competitors aiming to excel in ORC racing. It embodies the spirit of innovation and functionality that defines Nautor Swan.

Design Philosophy and Performance

The development of the ClubSwan 43 began over two years ago with the goal of creating a yacht that not only excels in one-design racing but also performs well within the ORC rating system. Achieving this balance required meticulous design and engineering, considering the compromises inherent in building a boat for dual purposes. Through extensive testing and evaluation of various design alternatives, the team developed a yacht that meets these diverse needs, offering both standard and optimized configurations to enhance performance in specific racing conditions.

Customization and Optimization

The ClubSwan 43 offers several customization options to fine-tune its performance. Owners can adjust the boat's configuration by removing a 250-kilogram pocket from the keel bulb and selecting a different mainsail, such as a pinhead main instead of the standard high-roach design. These adjustments significantly improve the boat's rating and performance ratio, particularly in light wind conditions, making the ClubSwan 43 highly competitive in ORC racing.

Versatile Cockpit and User-Friendly Features

The cockpit of the ClubSwan 43 was carefully designed through mockups and consultations with sailors to ensure it meets the needs of both racing crews and cruising families. The layout is optimized for performance-focused sailing while remaining comfortable and functional for leisure use. This versatility makes the ClubSwan 43 an excellent choice for owners who want a yacht that can transition smoothly between competitive racing and relaxed cruising.

Conclusion

The ClubSwan 43 successfully combines the thrill of high-performance sailing with the comfort of a family cruiser. Its modern design, advanced features, and ability to adapt to various racing conditions make it a standout in its class. This summer (2024), the ClubSwan 43 is set to showcase its capabilities at the ORC World Championship and the Rolex Swan Cup, highlighting its potential as a top contender in both competitive and cruising environments."

Exterior and interior design

A lightweight racing yacht of only 2.5 tons displacement, with a flat deck and beveled bow, is equipped with a double rudder feather, retractable bowsprit and a C-shaped foyer that extends from the hull at various angles using a hoist. The foil has an auxiliary function and solves two tasks: it creates lateral force and reduces resistance. All this makes the boat very fast on full courses.


Amenities on board

The carbon mast with steppe on deck has only one pair of paints, providing a wide range of settings for sailing weapons. The mast base position is adjustable.


For offshore racing, the cabin can be equipped with extra beds for relaxation and when the entrance to the cabin is closed, it becomes absolutely waterproof, so that even in storm conditions the crew will always have dry space.

Features

ClubSwan 36 is an amateur class run by the owners. The share of professional yachtsmen in the crew shall not exceed 50%.

At the same time it is the most high-tech racing monotype of the initial level.


Thanks to the patented C-foil system, it is able to walk on leeward courses with a roll of 22 degrees, and on windward courses - 12-15 degrees.

45 years ago, the original Swan 65, designed by Sparkman & Stephens, launched as the largest production boat on the market and won the first Whitbread Round the World Race, becoming a legend. The new 2019 Swan 65, designed by Germán Frers, maintains the legacy with modern enhancements, offering double the volume of its predecessor. This new model continues the tradition of combining luxurious cruising with competitive racing capabilities, attracting significant attention even before its debut.

Design and Exterior

The Swan 65, part of a new generation of Swans, shares design elements with the larger Swan 78. The yacht features clean, powerful lines with a beamy hull, emphasizing stability and performance. The telescopic keel, reducing draft from 4.2 to 2.8 meters, exemplifies advanced engineering, providing flexibility and ease of navigation in various waters. Built by APM in Italy, this keel also appears on high-end yachts like the Baltic 67 and Solaris 64, highlighting the Swan 65's top-tier construction.

Designed for owner management, the Swan 65 boasts a clean deck layout with all lines led underdeck to two winches on each side, allowing for efficient single-handed sailing. Optional features include a captive winch system and a bridge deck, which can create a more protected cockpit area.

The Solaris 111, crafted by Performance Boats in Forlì, is an exquisite blend of performance and luxury. With its sleek design by Soto Acebal and meticulous attention to detail, this yacht is a true masterpiece.

Deck and Exterior

The first striking feature of the Solaris 111 is its expansive deck space, highlighted by the aft beach terrace. This area provides direct access to the owner’s private cabin, ensuring complete privacy from the crew. The yacht boasts a beam of 7.8 meters, offering ample lounging space and clean, uncluttered decks. The deck design includes flush hatches and titanium fittings, maintaining a seamless and elegant appearance.

The Solaris 111 features a 50-meter ultra-high modulus Southern Spars rig with EC6 carbon rigging, delivering exceptional performance. The mainsail and self-tacking jib are managed by Magic Trim hydraulic systems, allowing for effortless sail handling. This innovative setup eliminates the need for visible sheets, contributing to the yacht's clean and modern look.

Interior Layout

Entering the Solaris 111, you are greeted by a raised saloon that offers a spacious and inviting area for relaxation and dining. The design ensures that the telescopic keel does not impact the interior space, allowing for a seamless flow throughout the yacht. The saloon’s elevated platform provides ample room for the engine room below, without compromising on comfort or style.

Owner’s Suite and Guest Accommodation

The owner's suite is the highlight of the Solaris 111, occupying a massive 40 square meters of space. This luxurious suite includes twin ensuite heads and direct access to the aft beach terrace. The terrace, measuring another 40 square meters, features a sunken cockpit that allows natural light to flood the owner’s suite. This unique design ensures total privacy and a connection to the sea that is unparalleled.

The yacht also includes three guest cabins, each meticulously designed with high-end materials such as cashmere carpets and Alcantara fabrics. The guest cabins offer ample storage and luxurious amenities, ensuring a comfortable stay for all aboard. The portside cabin features twin berths, while the starboard cabin includes a drop-down bunk, making it versatile for different guest needs.

Crew Quarters and Engine Room

The crew quarters are designed to provide functionality and comfort, with a dedicated galley and mess area. The yacht is crewed by five, including the skipper, and the layout ensures that the crew's activities are segregated from the guest areas. The engine room is accessible via a tunnel that houses twin washing machines and provides near full-beam access for easy maintenance.

The engine room is equipped with a 430-horsepower main engine and a generator with a PTO. The layout is clean and organized, allowing for efficient service and maintenance. The hydraulic systems, AC units, and water makers are all neatly installed, showcasing the yacht’s high level of engineering.

Performance and Technology

The Solaris 111 is built for performance, with a 75-ton displacement and 25 tons in the telescopic keel. The yacht features pre-preg carbon construction, ensuring a lightweight yet robust structure. The advanced rigging and sail handling systems, combined with the telescopic keel, provide exceptional sailing capabilities, making the Solaris 111 a true performance cruiser.

Conclusion

The Solaris 111 is a stunning example of modern yacht design, combining performance, luxury, and innovative features. With its expansive deck space, luxurious owner’s suite, and high-end materials, this yacht offers an unparalleled sailing experience. Whether for private use or as a charter vessel, the Solaris 111 sets a new standard in the world of performance cruising yachts."

The Solaris 60, known as a ""Mini Maxi,"" represents an entry-level vessel in the grand world of Maxi yachts. Designed for major regattas and blue water cruising, this boat is built to navigate in all wind and sea conditions.

Design and Performance

The Solaris 60 is an evolution of the successful Solaris 58, featuring new water lines and increased volumes. Designed by Javier Soto Acebal, renowned for his high-performing and safe hull designs, the yacht has a double rudder blade and a longitudinal garage for a tender up to 2.9 meters. The deck is clean and streamlined, with a spacious cockpit that allows for easy movement and a clear view of the bow.

The boat's raised central dinette separates it from the midship kitchen, which boasts significant volume. The open cockpit design enhances airflow and usability, making it a comfortable space for both racing and cruising.

Interior Layout

The interior of the Solaris 60, designed by Patrick Roséo, offers options for three or four cabins plus a sailor's cabin located at the bow. The owner's cabin can feature either a built-in or central bed. In the four-cabin version, there are two bunk beds, while the three-cabin version offers a more open and airy layout, creating a loft-like feel in the living area.

The craftsmanship is of the highest quality, with options for different wood finishes, including standard oak and classic teak. Customizations in lacered or unlacered wardrobes and cabinets, as well as various flooring colors, are available to meet the owner's preferences.

Technical Specifications

The standard engine is a 75 horsepower Sail Drive, with optional upgrades to 110 or 150 horsepower. The yacht is equipped with an 11 kW generator to support installed air conditioning. The sail plan includes a large mainsail, an aluminum mast, and a carbon boom, with optional carbon mast for those interested in racing. The bow features a 110% Genoa or a self-tacking jib, and all head sails are available in colored options, especially the gennaker.

Handling and Control

The Solaris 60 is designed to be easily managed by two people, with electric winches and controls that allow for efficient handling. The deck is free of clutter, with sheets and halyards concealed under the deckhouse, leaving only the Genoa sheet outside.

The flush portholes and hidden spray hood support add to the clean aesthetics of the yacht. The self-tacking stay rail, positioned well back from the forestay, aids in handling strong wind conditions and enhances the overall sailing experience.

Conclusion

Combining performance, comfort, and high-quality craftsmanship, the Solaris 60 stands out as an excellent choice for extended periods on the water. Its robust design, advanced features, and customizable interiors make it a top contender in the Mini Maxi category. Whether for racing or cruising, the Solaris 60 offers a superb sailing experience."

Italian shipyard Solaris presented its new 44th model in Genoa in 2018.

Exterior and interior design.

One of the main premieres of the year, the Solaris 44, has changed in its model rangeSolaris One 44. Although both projects were the responsibility of Javier Soto Acebal, the new model has inherited almost nothing from its predecessor. On the contrary, while the 2011 model was a sports one, the 2018 Solaris 44 is already a racing cruiser in a new, more modern body. The waterline has become longer, width of 4.18 m is saved from a middel to the stern, there are two pens of the steering wheel, a jib and a bowsprit. Living spaces have changed less. The salon and cabins are minimalistic in decoration, but have everything you need. Optionally, a table can be added to the cockpit.

Amenities on board

There is a single version available with three cabins and two bathrooms. The shipyard offers no other placement options. The colour of the finishes (oak or teak) is the only choice. The yacht has enough space and amenities for the owner, crew (table in the salon folding) or friends.

Features

As Javier Soto Asebal noted in one interview, his style is not immediately visible. That's also true of Solaris 44. The absence of catchy chips and excessive amenities can disappoint the average person. But the quality of construction and running data will please the gambler with the experience of competition. The shipyard's reputation justifies the cost, which is slightly higher than the market price.

Swimming area

Certified in Category A, the Solaris 44 is still more suitable for coastal cruising, although the size of the fuel tank (220l for 40 hp engine) is slightly larger than that of the competitors. The water reserve is also increased - 380 liters."

The second model in the Raised Saloon range - 64RS - from Italian shipyard Solaris (flagship of the 68 RS range) was presented in Dusseldorf in 2019.

Exterior and interior design

Having successfully tried out the décor in the exclusive maxi yacht segment, Solaris has applied this concept to mass production. And with a number of bold solutions from her regular partner Javier Soto Acebal. The Solaris 64RS will surprise you with its cockpit entrance to the right, three master cabins and a three meter dinghy garage aft. In addition, the Solaris 64RS is superb under sail and spectacular in appearance thanks to its modern hull rims and optional graphite gelcoat. The saloon has a large dining area to starboard, a lounge to starboard and a galley at the mast. The oak trim creates a pleasant atmosphere.

Amenities on board

All Solaris 64RS cabins are rightfully called the «Master». Each of the three offers en-suite amenities at impressive pillow heights. The shipyard is particularly proud of the soundproofing system in each of the three cabins. Optionally, a fourth cabin with a piano bathroom can be added and another «sideboard» in the central area by reducing the galley area.

Features

With bold solutions, the 64RS promises a revolution in the mini-maxi yacht market. This is yet to be tested, but already now you can be sure that 64RS will provide comfort and exciting racing for both small and full crew, as the giant sail area and 8.5 tons of ballast are not just there.

Swimming area

Category A certified, Solaris 64RS offers a weak 110 hp engine in its base. It is better to choose the optional 150 or even 180 hp engine at once. The fuel and water reserves of 800l and 900l respectively are satisfactory."

Period of manufacture
from 2020",https://itboat.com/models/10901-allures-51-9,"Allures 51.9 Overview

The Allures 51.9 is a robust and versatile aluminum yacht designed for long-distance navigation and all-sea conditions. This model is the third in its range, following its predecessors' success, with one already sailing in the Fiji Islands. Designed by Berret Racoupeau and constructed by Allures Yachting, the yacht boasts significant expertise in aluminum boat construction.

Key Features and Design

The yacht has an overall length of just over 16.5 meters and a beam of 4.8 meters. The keel is adjustable from a maximum draft of 3.05 meters to a minimum of just under 1.4 meters. This feature enhances the yacht's versatility, particularly useful for navigating shallow waters like Polynesian atolls.

Built to withstand all sea conditions, the boat includes multiple bow sails, large winches, firm wheelhouses, and handrails for added stability and safety. Supports near the mast are particularly useful in bad weather, and a spinnaker pole is included for optimal sailing angles during crossings like the Atlantic.

The cockpit is designed for protection from waves and sun, with a sturdy wheelhouse that allows for comprehensive management of the boat. The layout is suitable for owners who often sail alone or with minimal crew, emphasizing ease of use and safety.

Interior Features

The interior galley is designed for comfort and functionality, allowing cooking while sailing. It features excellent amenities, including refrigerators, to support long voyages. The saloon is elevated to house installations and tanks underneath, providing a high seating area that offers scenic views of the sea while seated.

Located aft, the master cabin is spacious and comfortable, with a window offering views towards the stern. The design prioritizes volume and comfort, ensuring a pleasant living experience on long journeys.

Conclusion

The Allures 51.9 is a well-crafted yacht suitable for adventurous sailors looking to navigate various sea conditions with ease and comfort. Its robust design, versatile keel, and thoughtful interior layout make it an excellent choice for long-distance cruising."

Alphena Three is a kind of development of the idea of a cruiser - it's already more of a weekend cruiser than a cruiser. But the weekend is still pretty ""hot"" for the light of a big power structure. Unlike the younger model, the yacht now has a fully functional saloon, dressing room, galley and a small bow cabin. The interior is original - on the sides there are special deformable panels with soft upholstery, which can be curved in the berth and used as soft sofas.
A similar solution is also used in the spacious 14 m² cockpit: there can be special sitting cushions, again with ample transformation possibilities. With this in mind, the number of options for placing and using removable furniture in the cockpit tends to infinity.
Speed qualities of the yacht are exceptionally high due to its long length by KVL and high energy efficiency (about 30 m²/t)."

Two years after the presentation of the Amel 50, the French shipyard has launched the next sailing model with a central protected cockpit. In 2020, the boat received the title of European Yacht of the Year in the Luxury-Cruiser category.

Exterior and Interior Design

From the previous model Amel 60, for the development of which was responsible studio Berret Racoupeau Yachts Design, differ additional 3 meters of length and an extended cockpit. The steep sides allowed to increase the volume of both the living space inside the sailboat and the engine room.


Amenities on board

A large square cabin with a table for 8 people, a state-of-the-art galley and three double cabins with private bathrooms await guests below deck. A dozen square opening hatches on deck and three opening portholes allow daylight to penetrate the living areas and make them visually superior.


Features

All control of the boat is moved into a deep protected cockpit. The deckhouse is protected by a rigid sliding roof.

The centre of gravity of the carbon mast with the twist of the Amel 60 is lower than that of the Amel 50 and the mast is lighter, making the sailboat both faster and more comfortable. Well, safety and simplicity in operation are the shipyard's priorities when designing all models.

Swimming area

Category «A» certification means that it is quite possible to safely go far from shore on this sailing boat. The protected cockpit will allow you to enjoy yachting even in strong winds and waves, when the water splashes a lot when hitting the boat. The spacious sunbathing areas on deck and the large comfortable bathing platform make this boat suitable for travel in warm waters."

Period of manufacture
from 2020",https://itboat.com/models/10219-astus-22-5,"Astus 22.5 Overview

Speed trailer multihull with optional foyles is suitable for both cruise and sporting events.

Exterior and Interior Design

Astus 22.5 was born as a development of the concept «of personal» trimarans Astus 16.5 and Astus 20.5 and in collaboration with VPLP Design, known for its offshore racing trimarans, among others, as well as developments for the Lagoon brand.

Amenities on board

The living area is ascetic, but it's still there. Basically, Astus 22.5 can be considered as a yacht for family holidays - the hull can accommodate up to 4 beds. The sail plan includes a mainsail, jib and gennaker.

Features .

The option to install optional foyles turns this yacht into a sport facility and allows you to fully experience the control and speed of a hydrofoil sailing vessel. However, according to the shipyard, even without foyles, the Astus 22.5 is capable of speeds up to 20 knots. The economic yacht is easy to maintain and can even be stored in the garage. For different types of clients, the shipyard offers both cruising and sports versions.

Sailing area

The Astus 22.5 is easy to transport on a specially adapted trailer - the connecting arms slide to press the side floats against the central body. Thanks to the ease of movement, the boat offers its owners many water areas that are inaccessible to a large boat."

526
Period of manufacture
from 2013",https://itboat.com/models/9995-balance-catamarans-526,"Balance 526 Overview

The Balance 526 is a high-performance catamaran born from the vision of broker Phillip Berman, who collaborated with renowned designer Anton Du Toit. Built in South Africa by Nexus Yachts under the supervision of Jonathan Paarman, this 16-meter vessel is crafted for speed, with composite structures that allow it to weigh between 11 to 12 tons, depending on the onboard options.

Design and Layout

Designed to be lightweight, the Balance 526 offers an option for daggerboards, allowing the catamaran to achieve better windward performance with a draft of 2.2 meters. For those who prefer a simpler setup, fixed keels with a draft of 1.4 meters are available. The interior design cleverly maximizes space, with the beds in the guest cabins integrated into the crossbeam connecting the two hulls, providing ample sleeping space, though access may require a few steps.

The owner's hull is a spacious retreat, featuring a large bed, a long corridor, and an expansive bathroom. This configuration offers plenty of storage and comfort, making it an ideal choice for long voyages.

Innovative Features

The Balance 526 is equipped with an advanced electrical system that includes seven solar panels with individual regulators, capable of generating over 2 kilowatts per hour. This setup ensures that the boat's energy needs are met primarily by solar power during navigation. The design also allows for continued power generation even if part of a panel is shaded.

The catamaran's galley is practical, featuring three gas burners that are easy to use while sailing and do not consume precious electrical power. The open-plan design between the galley and saloon can be fully enclosed for air conditioning or opened up to the cockpit when the weather is pleasant.

Performance and Navigation

Powered by two 57-horsepower Yanmar engines, each equipped with dual alternators, the Balance 526 can cruise at 8 knots with engines running at around 2,200 RPM, reaching up to 11 knots at full throttle. However, this catamaran is designed primarily for sailing, with engines serving as auxiliary power when necessary.

In terms of sailing performance, the Balance 526 is impressive, capable of covering up to 250 nautical miles per day and achieving speeds of over 20 knots. For more typical cruising, the catamaran comfortably maintains speeds between 10 to 15 knots, even with family-friendly settings. The daggerboards can be partially deployed to improve directional stability, especially when sailing downwind.

Conclusion

The Balance 526 is a sailor's catamaran, offering a blend of speed, efficiency, and comfort. With reported speeds of over 20 knots and the ability to cover significant distances daily, it is not your average cruising catamaran. Ideal wind conditions range between 15 to 20 knots, where the Balance 526 can fully unleash its power and performance. This catamaran is a top choice for those seeking a balance between luxury and high-performance sailing."

Exterior and interior design

In 2018, the sailing catamaran Bali 4.8 was launched and received the brand's signature chips, including the rigid bridge structure on the foredeck. The 14.28m multihull is designed in a mainstream style and offers plenty of space for both indoor and outdoor relaxation. The naval architecture was done by Xavier FAŸ studio, and the interior was designed by Lasta Design Studio.

Amenities on board

The saloon and aft cockpit are combined by a spectacular solution with lifting doors, while the forward-facing rest area can be accessed through wide side aisles or the saloon. The helm station on the flybridge is conveniently located with a 360-degree view of the cockpit. An additional plus is the maximum automation of sailing, so the boat can be handled by a minimum of family members.

Features of Bali 4.8

The catamaran offers quite wide cabins compared to other manufacturers. There are also separate exits to the cockpit from the aft cabins. On the lower deck, up to five layouts are possible, suitable for a wide variety of client requirements.

Cruising area

The boat is certified for sailing in the oceans, and the almost 8-metre beam provides good stability. The low draft (1.35 m) allows you to get close to the shore, although if you want you can always take «a dinghy» with you."

Exterior and Interior Design

This house-on-the-water-like yacht will please those who love the comfort and large living spaces. Bali 5.4, the family cruiser, is awarded the title Multihull of the Year. The new vision for a cruising catamaran is the result of a collaboration between the concept creator of the brand, Olivier Poncin, naval architect Xavier Faӱ and the design studio Lasta Design.

Amenities on board

The big salon combines a galley and a dining area for 12 people. The equipment of the former includes, among other things, a two-door refrigerator and an ice maker.

A folding door separates the forward «hard» cockpit from the saloon, and when the door is open, the whole area becomes a single lounge. Layouts are available in versions with 4 to 6 different-sized cabins. The crew quarters are at the bow of the hulls. On the flybridge, in addition to the control station, there is an al fresco refectory and sunbathing area for guests.

Features of Bali 5.4

The on-board generator provides with energy air conditioner, heater, dishwasher and washing machine, while other Bali 5.4 power systems use batteries and solar panels. Although this catamaran can be operated singlehandedly, some owners still prefer an additional bow thruster. The water tank capacity of 1200 litres is not large based on the potential capacity of the yacht, so the desalter for Bali 5.4 is almost mandatory.

Cruising area

The yacht has a draft of 1.48m, so it is possible to enter the shallow waters without fear. Bali 5.4 is ready for sailing around the world, although it is more confined to warm sunny areas."

Archambault M34 was created to participate in the competition announced by the organizers of the regular regatta. Tour de France a la Voile to replace an older model Farr 30and I won this contest. It is a very powerful boat with a large sailing area and a higher surface area than the Farr 30, allowing it to be used even for ocean (including transatlantic) regattas.
To increase mobility (yachts participating in the Tour de France race must move from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean coast), the yacht has a rising keel and a carbon plastic mast consisting of two parts.

The designers Joubert and Nivo have done a great job designing this small boat and optimizing it for the IRC measurement rules. The hull is built by infusion process, the structural reinforcement and the deck section are made by injection.
The boat has a very high energy efficiency and, as a result, excellent speed characteristics. The interiors are modest, but the A31 is very spacious for its size - for example, the height of the pillowcase in the cabin is 182 centimeters.

The Archambault A35 is positioned as a kind of crossover - a yacht that can be used both as a family cruiser and as a racing boat, optimized for IRC measurement rules. The hull form of the A35 is suitable both for racing «around buoys»and for offshore events. The boat is characterized by exceptional quality of the steering mechanism - from the stop to the stop the steering wheel makes only one revolution, while friction and resistance in the gear is reduced to a minimum. The result is an exceptional «boat» feel and the ability to steer the boat with short, precise movements.


Inside the boat has a fairly large volume and a simple but comfortable interior, designed on the principle of nothing «extra. But its main advantage is not that: The A35 has a huge number of victories and successful performances in regattas around the world."

The Archambault A40RC reveals its purpose at a glance: a huge open cockpit (it occupies exactly one third of the boat's length), two titanium (!) handwheels, a sharp nose with a vertical shaft and high-performance sailing weapons can only belong to a racing yacht. Although the yacht description indicates that it is a racer/cruiser, it is only a marketing slyness. Of course it is possible to spend a weekend on it with family or friends - but it is better to spend it in a gambling race. The layout of the cockpit (especially the location of the mainsail tuner) can be an example of an ergonomically successful solution. The deck space is spacious, but unpretentious - clearly not the Ritz hotel.
The hull of the boat has a rational system of longitudinal and transverse reinforcements, which give it particular torsional rigidity. The high proportion of ballast weight in the displacement of the boat (48.5%) gives it an excellent stability.

Launched in 2019, the Bente Yachts 39 Mediterranean Cockpit cruiser has become perhaps the most extravagant sailing yacht on the German market in recent years. The sailing yacht has received the maximum glazed superstructure. During the day, the salon receives a lot of natural light and the spotlight complements the futuristic interior picture.

Comfort on board.

The cockpit is ascetic and more designed to work with sails than to rest, but there is a staircase for lifting out of the water, and a small sunbathing area at the bow can be arranged. The salon has a harmonious kitchen with plenty of storage space for utensils and supplies, a dining area, two separate cabins and a combined bathroom.

Features

The yacht has a place for a navigating table, which is located inside, on the right side of the entrance. Owners will also appreciate the visor above the entrance, under which they can hide from the piercing wind.

Swimming area

The shipyard offers a rather modest basic package, which can be extended with a rich set of options, but even in the standard configuration the ship can go out into the open ocean."

Period of manufacture

The Bestevaer 36, built by KM Yachtbuilders in Makkum, Netherlands, is an aluminum yacht designed for rugged, go-anywhere sailing. The boat was created for Jerry Dykstra, a legendary racing sailor and designer, who wanted a smaller vessel to navigate the wetlands of the Netherlands. The Bestevaer series is known for its durability and sustainability, making the 36 a notable addition to the lineup.

Technical Specifications and Design

The Bestevaer 36 is constructed primarily from recycled aluminum, with over 60% of the material being recycled. This construction not only emphasizes the boat's eco-friendly focus but also ensures durability and longevity. The yacht features a centerboard keel and a kick-up rudder, allowing it to dry out easily. Its bare aluminum exterior, sandblasted for a non-skid effect, is typical for Bestevaer yachts. The boat’s sails are made from recycled polyester by Elvstrom and include a Fathead Square top main with running backstays and a Jib-O-Boom stay sail option.

Cockpit and Deck Features

The cockpit of the Bestevaer 36 is deep and protected, designed for high-latitude sailing. It includes a massive starboard locker for ample storage, housing the Oceanvolt electric drive and Fischer Panda generator. The helm area features a versatile running board that doubles as a gang plank and a helm seat that slides back and forth. The transom includes a swim platform with steps that lower for easy access to the water and life raft.

Interior and Sustainability

Inside, the Bestevaer 36 offers a cozy, traditional interior with modern sustainable touches. The dark-stained oak interior and recycled linoleum around the hatch contribute to the boat's eco-friendly design. The yacht includes a double berth and a quarter berth, ideal for a couple on remote adventures. The centerboard yacht has a hydraulic system for the center plate, reducing the draft from 2.4 meters for sailing to about one meter for drying out. The boat's insulation consists of spray cork below the waterline and non-porous mineral wool above, ensuring a well-insulated environment.

Conclusion

The Bestevaer 36 is a high-quality, custom yacht designed for serious sailors. While compact, it offers exceptional build quality and sustainability."

Interior and exterior design

The modern cockpit design was borrowed from the Boréal 55 OS. She has two steering wheels on board, although there is only one rudder blade. All rigging elements are led to a single central winch.

The resting area is completely separate from the helm, so that while the skipper and his assistants are busy setting sails, the rest of the guests can stay close by and still be at ease. Swimming from the boat during anchorages will be easy thanks to the large aft platform.

Compared to the Boréal 47,the ceilings in this model's cabins are noticeably higher. Similar changes apply to the helmsman's area at the entrance to the lower deck, which is also protected by a canopy roof. Access to the helm station from this area is freely accessible aft.

Onboard amenities

There are three double cabins, two aft and one forward. Each cabin has its own lavatory. In the forward cabin, the bathroom is separate.

The galley located amidships is equipped with an enlarged fridge with two drawers. In addition, there is a space for a separate deep-freezer. There is also enough space for a dishwasher.

Features of

The boat has been designed based on the wishes of more than 60 owners of a Boréal 44 and a Boréal 47. And it has paid off. In 2021, the boat won the title «European Yacht of the Year» in the category «Bluewater Cruiser». She also won the Special Jury Prize in the competition «Sailboat of the Year», hosted by Voile Magazine.

Sailing region

The boatyard claims it is safe to travel to the ends of the earth on this boat. Thanks to the well-thought-out and concise deck layout, even an incomplete crew can do it."

With its robust construction, clever design features, and attention to detail, this vessel is built to handle the most challenging sailing conditions while providing comfort and safety for extended voyages.

Design and Construction

The Boreal 44.2 is crafted from aluminum, a material chosen for its durability and resistance to corrosion, making it ideal for long-term ocean cruising. The boat features hard chines, which enhance stability, although they slightly reduce interior space. The twin rudders provide excellent control, especially in heavy seas, and the large bathing platform, complete with a swimming ladder, adds a practical touch for those looking to enjoy their time at anchor.

The aft cabins are spacious, with good headroom and thoughtful storage solutions, making them ideal for guests or additional crew.

Technical and Safety Features

One of the standout aspects of the Boreal 44.2 is its focus on safety and ease of maintenance.

The C-Cat 48, an Italian-built lightweight performance catamaran, is known for its modern hull shapes and ultra-fine bows. With impressive capabilities in light wind conditions, it stands out among its peers.

Performance and Design

The C-Cat 48 features ultra-fine bows and long, modern hull shapes that allow it to slice through the water effortlessly. The vessel's lightweight construction, with a standard weight of just 9.5 tons for a 48-foot catamaran, is a significant factor in its performance. The boat is built using carbon for the coach roof, bulkheads, bowsprit, and davits, ensuring minimal weight aloft.

Sailing Capabilities

One of the C-Cat 48's remarkable attributes is its ability to sail efficiently upwind. It matches the angle and speed of well-regarded monohulls and other performance-oriented catamarans. This is largely due to its lightweight build and advanced sail handling systems. The catamaran's daggerboard design further enhances its upwind capabilities, allowing for reduced leeway and improved performance in various wind conditions.

Interior Layout

The interior of the C-Cat 48 is designed with performance and comfort in mind. The standard setup features a three-cabin layout with a forward-facing nav station, compact saloon, and a well-ventilated U-shaped galley. The guest cabins on the port side provide adequate space, although the focus remains on maintaining a lightweight and performance-oriented build. The owner's hull on the starboard side offers more space and privacy, including a heads and separate shower area.

Construction and Craftsmanship

Crafted by the family-owned shipyard near Rome, the C-Cat 48 showcases high-quality construction and attention to detail. The use of foam core materials and carbon reinforcements throughout the vessel ensures a robust yet lightweight structure. The engines are positioned centrally, under the aft cockpit, to keep weight distribution optimal and maintain the catamaran's agility and speed.

Conclusion

The C-Cat 48 stands out as a high-performance, lightweight catamaran that excels in various sailing conditions. Its modern design, advanced construction techniques, and thoughtful interior layout make it an excellent choice for sailors seeking both speed and comfort. The C-Cat 48 showcases the best of Italian yacht craftsmanship and design."

Catana, known for its high-performance ocean catamarans, has re-entered the market with the new Ocean Class 50. This marks the brand's return after focusing on its Bali range. Debuting at the Grand Pavois La Rochelle Boat Show, the Catana Ocean Class 50 promises robust performance and luxurious comfort for long-distance cruising.

Exterior Features

The Catana Ocean Class 50 features a forward-mounted anchor on the crossbeam, with the chain leading to a midships windlass and chain locker. The deck layout includes steps to the coach roof, accommodating both a Genoa and a self-tacking jib. The yacht's carbon bulkheads and daggerboards ensure durability and stability, while maintaining a sleek design. The helm station, equipped with a 57 horsepower engine option, provides excellent visibility and control, making it ideal for both casual cruising and serious sailing.

Interior Design

The Ocean Class 50 boasts a spacious and innovative interior. Sliding doors and windows create an open, airy environment, merging indoor and outdoor spaces seamlessly. The saloon features a dedicated relaxation area forward, separated by a well-appointed galley. A standout feature is the raised navigation station, offering commanding views and easy communication with the helm. The use of carbon and other high-quality materials throughout the interior enhances both aesthetics and functionality.

Accommodation and Storage

Designed with long-distance cruising in mind, the Catana Ocean Class 50 offers ample storage and a flexible layout. The owner's version includes a luxurious master cabin with extensive storage and a walk-in shower. Alternative layouts can include additional cabins, such as bunk cabins, to accommodate more guests. Every inch of the yacht is optimized for storage, ensuring sufficient space for all necessities on extended voyages.

Sailing and Performance

Despite its 13.5-ton weight, the Catana Ocean Class 50 is designed to handle a payload of up to 19.5 tons, making it a sturdy and reliable vessel for ocean crossings. The yacht features a unique single helm station accessible from the deck, with separate winch areas and helm positions. The bridled mainsail setup, instead of a full beam traveler, offers easy sail handling. The helm station provides excellent visibility and access to all running rigging, making it simple to manage even in challenging conditions.

Conclusion

The Catana Ocean Class 50 is a testament to Catana's expertise in building high-performance, ocean-capable catamarans. With its blend of luxury, practicality, and robust design, it is well-suited for long-distance cruising."

46 SQ
Period of manufacture
from 2023",https://itboat.com/models/16557-dehler-46-sq,"Dehler 46 SQ Overview

The Dehler 46SQ represents an evolution of the original 2014 design by Judel/Vrolijk. With subtle enhancements and modern features, this yacht continues to impress as a performance cruiser, offering both competitive sailing capabilities and luxurious comfort.

Exterior Features

The Dehler 46SQ retains its proven hull design, making only minor adjustments to enhance functionality and aesthetics. A key update is the integrated bowsprit, allowing for better sail handling and improved anchor placement. The cockpit layout is largely unchanged but now includes an electric folding bathing platform for added convenience. The German main sheet system has been adapted, enabling the trimmer to control the main sheet from both the helm and trimming positions.

Wide side decks, inboard rails for Genoa sheets, and outboard chain plates ensure safe and easy access forward. The addition of an inner stay sail offers versatility, especially in heavy weather, and the flat deck Furler for the Genoa further enhances performance.

Cockpit and Deck Layout

The cockpit remains functional and spacious, featuring a six-winch layout and a Cascade system for the backstay. This setup ensures easy adjustment and trimming, appealing to performance sailors. The integrated traveler is a standard feature, providing precise control over sail shape.

Moving forward, the yacht boasts ample deck space with good non-slip surfaces and grab handles for safety. The sail locker and chain locker offer practical storage solutions, while the waterproof and crash-proof bulkheads add to the vessel's robustness.

Interior Design

The interior of the Dehler 46SQ is contemporary and elegant, featuring a mahogany finish with options for teak, oak, and cherry. The main improvements focus on maximizing volume and storage space, particularly in the galley. Enhanced cold storage and additional styling details, such as curved lockers and a dedicated drinks area, contribute to a luxurious onboard experience.

A standout feature is the optional chart table, allowing for a forward-facing navigation station. The electric sliding seat in the saloon adds flexibility, making it easy to create additional seating or maintain clear access to the forward cabin. Enlarged coach roof windows bring in more natural light, enhancing the sense of space and comfort.

Accommodation and Machinery

The yacht offers a flexible layout with scissor berths in the aft cabins, allowing for either twin or double configurations. Both aft cabins benefit from increased natural light and easy access to the machinery space. The 57 horsepower Yanmar Sail Drive is easily accessible for maintenance, with companionway steps lifting to provide full access to the engine and sail drive.

The two heads compartments each feature separate showers, ensuring privacy and convenience for guests. The forward cabin includes a vanity table and ample storage, making it a comfortable retreat.

Conclusion

The Dehler 46SQ builds on a successful design, incorporating modern updates to enhance performance, comfort, and functionality. Whether used for competitive sailing or leisurely cruising, this yacht offers a versatile and luxurious experience on the water."

30 OD
Period of manufacture
from 2019",https://itboat.com/models/10060-dehler-30-od,"Dehler 30 OD Overview

The Dehler 30OD premiered in September 2019. The yacht is suitable for both racing and high-speed cruises.

Exterior and Interior Design

The monotype has an attractive appearance with aggressive lines, smooth housing design and catlike «superstructure windows». The project was designed by the architectural bureau judel/vrolijk. The interiors were created by engineers from the same company in collaboration with the shipyard's designers.

Facilities on board

Living area is optimal for two people, otherwise the feeling «of the keel in the can» will not pass. There are two berths at the stern and one at the bow if there is no sail storage. There is a small galley and an isolated bathroom. Sleep, cook hot food and wash off salt after watching - what else does a wet tired racer need?

Features

An open large cockpit, adjustable buckstags, and a full-fledged epaulet for the geek-boat are signs that the Dehler 30OD will perform much better than conventional cruisers. The monotype is equipped with a grotto with a rectangular top, an almost meter long bowsprit can carry a gennaker. The rowing screw is removed inside the hull and does not interfere with sailing. The life raft is stored in an easily accessible compartment below deck in the cockpit. The Dehler 30OD is smaller than its competitors like SunFast 3300 or Figaro 3. However, the former offers an honest classic and uncompromising saling without, for example, foyles, which require additional skills.

Swimming area

The yacht is primarily aimed at offshore regattas of singles or doubles. The stability and stability of the boat is ensured by a 2.2 m long keel and ballast tanks."

from 2017",https://itboat.com/models/8887-elan-gt5,"Elan GT5 Overview

Ownership change in the GT5 has been recognized as the Year in USA;A control panel design has received the DAME Design Award.Elan Group prompted the company to update its line of yachts, where performance cruiser Elan GT5 took a special place. The model made its debut in 2016 in Paris.

Interior and exterior

Designed by Rob Humphreys and in-house designers, the Elan GT5 is the entry point for the«Slovenian yard. Modern bypasses with cheekbones, two rudder blades, car glazing of the deck salon, spacious cockpit, black inserts in the superstructure - all these are elements of Mediterranean chic.

The interior of the yacht looks spacious thanks to the light finish and panoramic glazing. The galley, offset to the forward cabin, looks unusual. However, the interior is standard; you can optionally choose the trendy cold shade of the interior panels.

Amenities on board

The shipyard obviously tried to get the boat loaded with all sorts of «chips». A bathing platform has been added, a sunbathing area can be arranged in the cockpit, a large dining area is formed by two tables and there is a possibility to install a grill. The interior layout can be 2 or 3 cabins in different finishes.

Features .

In the GT5 design, the design is put at the heart of the design. Elan Group emphasizes that the GT5 offers the comfort «available to owners of larger yachts». Given the relatively affordable price, the owner of the GT5 can really impress with his boat.

Elan Group's efforts were not in vain. The GT5 was named «Yacht of the Year» in the USA and the design of the control panel received the DAME Design Award.

Swimming area

While the benefits of GT5 can be appreciated without embarking on long voyages, the yacht still holds a category A certificate."

It did not go unnoticed by the visitors of the exhibitions where this yacht was shown - everyone noticed not only the pleasant appearance of the boat, but also the surprisingly comfortable interior. A characteristic feature - although due to the double hull construction (there is a powerful layer of foam between the outer and outer hulls with a large layer of foam.closed cells) internal volumes are noticeably smaller than those of other yachts of comparable lengths, rational layout and elegant styling have led to the fact that no one notices this ""disappeared"" volume. The Etap 48ds also demonstrated new approaches to the use of structural materials.

The Etap 37s is radically different in its design from the 32s. The 37s, on the contrary, focuses on cruising qualities (although the boat is a little less spacious than many competitors - all because of the same unsinkability). The boat is not the fastest in class, but very comfortable and quiet - the double hull with a filler that gives the buoyancy is an excellent soundproofing. Thermal insulation is also excellent - the crew can forget about the condensation inside the yacht forever. For many yachtsmen, this can become even more important than total buoyancy.
This yacht is partly comparable to Volvo cars - they are not the fastest, not the most elegant, but some of the most reliable and safe."

Firstly, she is not designed for long voyages - she does not have enough volume to store supplies, but she has high speed qualities. It is not a long-haul cruiser, but a boat for fast transitions along the coast. Secondly, the yacht has a completely unique steering wheel - its tiller is not horizontal but vertical and the yacht is controlled by its deviation in the direction of the necessary board. Thirdly, the epaulet of the giki-skot, located in the middle of the cockpit at fish level, can be quickly removed and thus free the cockpit in the berth.

The Etap 26s has become - directly in line with the name of its brand - a stage yacht and a kind of trendsetter in the field of small cruisers. The yacht has gained popularity among yachtsmen as a result of a successful combination of technical solutions. Among them: deep, safe and well-planned cockpit, comfortable, spacious and well-equipped sub-deck space, possibility to move the yacht on a trailer, possibility to equip the yacht with different keel variants.- including a lifting and double keel, which makes it easy to navigate in shallow waters and makes it possible to launch the yacht directly from the trailer on the slip, without any crane.
Complementing this picture is the possibility of choosing an auxiliary engine, either stationary or suspended - floodability and as usual. Very good driving characteristics. Alas, the price of Etap 26s is a clear reflection of the sum of its advantages - for all good things you have to pay."

Alas, the amount of foam needed to ensure buoyancy has to be placed somewhere. But the speed qualities of the boat are excellent and it can click on the bow and larger boats. The ergonomics of the saloon and deck equipment is a tradition at Etap Shipyard.

The Excess 14 boasts a modern hull shape with thin, asymmetric keels for improved efficiency and deeper rudders for better control. The design focuses on weight reduction and stiffness, ensuring a smooth and responsive sailing experience. The boat's structure is optimized for minimal twisting and creaking in a seaway, providing a solid and quiet ride.

Sailing Performance

Equipped with a tall rig and more sail area under the pulse line option, the Excess 14 delivers impressive performance.

Cockpit and Helm

The cockpit of the Excess 14 is designed for both comfort and functionality. It includes a spacious seating area and a well-organized helm station. The helm provides easy access to all necessary controls, including winches for halyards, sheets, and the main traveler. The traveler is controlled by a powered flat winder, making it easy to adjust the mainsail. The steps up to the coach roof allow for easy access to the stack pack and ample space for lounging or additional seating.

Interior and Living Spaces

The interior of the Excess 14 is designed to maximize space and comfort. The saloon is connected to the aft cockpit area, creating an open and social environment. The galley is compact yet functional, with good storage and work surface areas. The nav station is cleverly integrated, allowing for a versatile workspace.

Owner's Hull and Cabins

The owner's hull offers a spacious and luxurious layout. It includes a large desk area, ample storage, and an adaptable utility space that can be converted into an additional cabin if needed. The ensuite head and separate shower provide comfort and convenience. The port hull features two double cabins, each with its own head and shower, offering plenty of natural light and storage.

Systems and Storage

The Excess 14 is equipped with a comprehensive set of systems, including batteries, chargers, and AC systems. The boat also features a large sail locker and ample storage spaces throughout, making it ideal for long-term cruising or living aboard.

The Excess 15 from a young French shipyard was presented in September 2019 and the boat immediately won the «Multi Hull of the Year» title at the British Yachting Awards.

Exterior and interior design

On attention to details at once it is appreciable that sailing cruising catamaran was developed by skilled experts. The shipbuilder has invited studio VPLP for creation of exteriors, and for interiors - Nauta Design. The result was an interesting non-standard boat with many exclusive solutions both inside and outside.

Amenities on board

The cockpit is decorated quite typically: a dining room with a table and an L-shaped sofa to starboard, a bar and a wide couch to starboard, and another sofa aft. The salon has a spacious crew cabin, galley and a large skipper's table. There is a choice of three cabins and a four-hectare charter version.

Features

In contrast to the Excess 11, the «mast» has been moved closer to the stern, allowing for the installation of a popular cruiser's automatic staysail and greatly simplifying the work with sails. Also, the crew did not install a separate semi-deck for the control post, as most manufacturers do on boats without flybridge, but made two posts on both sides closer to the stern. This allows you to choose the best view angle and simplifies the mooring procedure.

Swimming area

The yacht is prepared for small cruises and noisy parties, as well as for serious transatlantic crossings and long autonomous work."

Period of manufacture

The Faurby 460E is the flagship of the Danish boatyard, a vessel designed to offer both performance and comfort in a customizable package. With a deep focus on handcrafted quality and personalization, this yacht is ideal for owners who want to tailor their vessel to their preferences. Available in two versions, a sport variant with a carbon mast and a performance rig and a comfort version with more traditional setups, the 460E combines the best of Danish boat-building craftsmanship with modern sailing technology.

Deck Layout and Sailing Features

The Faurby 460E is designed with ease of sailing in mind. Its cockpit is spacious yet practical, allowing for single-handed sailing. All sail controls, including the sheets and halyards, are easily accessible near the companionway, operated via two large electric winches. The deck is remarkably clean, with lines hidden beneath the surface and running through stainless steel pipes, enhancing both aesthetics and functionality.

The rigging and deck equipment are top-tier, with carbon fiber being a key feature on the sportier variant, reducing weight and improving performance. The boat is capable of impressive speeds, even with light winds. During testing, the Faurby 460E demonstrated exceptional handling, maintaining 8.2 knots in moderate wind conditions, while its deep rudder ensures excellent control and stability.

Performance Comparison

While the Faurby 460E is not a racing yacht, it excels in both light and strong wind conditions. The deeper draft version offers enhanced stability in stronger winds, while the carbon fiber rig boosts the yacht’s speed. Both variants, despite their different configurations, performed remarkably well, with the carbon mast version expected to gain a slight edge once fully optimized.

Interior Design and Comfort

Below deck, the Faurby 460E is a true showcase of Scandinavian craftsmanship. Each yacht can be customized to the owner’s specifications, from the wood types to the smallest design details.

The interior layout is spacious and designed for comfort. The master cabin, located in the bow, features a large bed, ample storage, and plenty of headroom. A standout feature is the high-quality joinery, with solid wood doors and frames that are built to last. Even the heads (bathrooms) are well-appointed, with porcelain sinks, elegant fittings, and practical details like foldable shower enclosures.

Build Quality and Customization

Faurby prides itself on its craftsmanship, and this is evident in every detail of the 460E. The boat is built using a combination of traditional hand-lamination techniques and modern materials like carbon fiber, ensuring both strength and lightness. The shipyard’s ability to accommodate individual owner requests, from layout changes to specific wood types and finishes, sets it apart from mass-produced yachts.

The meticulous attention to detail extends to every corner of the boat, with clever storage solutions, custom furniture, and robust fixtures. This level of personalization allows owners to create a yacht that feels unique and tailored to their needs, whether they plan to cruise locally or undertake long-distance voyages."

The Faurby 360 was a variation on the previous, slightly larger model 363. The boat was purposefully built for its use on large European lakes: for this purpose it had reduced maximum width and draft, but gave it a very high sailing weapon, capable of effectively catching the typical lake riding wind.

For ease of manoeuvring in the same lake or river conditions the yacht is equipped with an automatic staysail, which makes the steering extremely easy. At the same time, the boat retains all the qualities necessary for long sea voyages."

When the boat was presented to the world, the experts were amazed at the Finnish approach - even the surfaces that are not visible to the eye were carefully covered with gelcoat. All fasteners are stainless steel only, and some things (winches, etc.) are larger than usual for yachts of this length. Such decision promotes greater reliability of the deck equipment.

Flash Catamarans Shipyard presents an ambitious project - a sailing catamaran Flash Sat 52 S. The yacht was designed by the famous French engineer Erick Lerouge with the highest level of comfort and performance with minimum weight. The impressive size of the Flash Sat 52 S is capable of speeds not typical of most cruising catamarans.

Flash Cat 52 S is built from epoxy resins and carbonate using the vacuum infusion method. Parts of the catamaran hull are made of Kevlar, others (mast, bow and bowsprit) are made of carbon. In addition, the use of very light wood has reduced the weight of the catamaran, allowing it to develop high speed while reducing fuel consumption."

The Gunboat 72 masterfully reconciles the challenge of combining exceptional comfort with high performance. Traditionally, comfort adds weight, which compromises performance. However, this model demonstrates that both can coexist.

Flybridge Innovation

The Gunboat 72 is the first in the series to feature a flybridge. Initially, incorporating a flybridge while maintaining Gunboat's renowned performance seemed impossible. Yet, after thorough analysis and client insistence, architects successfully integrated this feature without sacrificing performance. The result is a yacht that offers the benefits of a flybridge while upholding the high standards of Gunboat performance.

Design and Market Appeal

The flybridge is highly attractive to owners, opening the model to a broader market, especially in larger catamarans. The Gunboat 72 can sail efficiently in light winds, from 7-8 knots and above, a unique selling point that positions it ahead of non-flybridge competitors.

The Gunboat 72 caters to clients who love both performance sailing and the comfort of living onboard. The hull design, borrowed from the Gunboat 68, features thin, lightweight hulls that balance comfort with performance. The inclusion of symmetric daggerboards enhances upwind sailing capabilities, offering better grip and smaller sailing angles.

This model is designed for those who appreciate high performance and luxurious comfort, making it ideal for both avid sailors and those seeking a premium cruising experience. The Gunboat 72 successfully blends speed, stability, and spacious living, setting a new standard in the luxury performance catamaran market."

HH Catamarans has unveiled the innovative HH 52, drawing inspiration from the highly successful HH 44, which has sold over 30 units, and the award-winning HH 50. This new model is set to elevate the standards of luxury cruising and high-performance sailing.

Overview

The HH 52 builds on the foundation of the award-winning HH 50, recognized as Cruising World magazine's Best Luxury Cruiser of 2021. The HH 50 offered options in full carbon fiber for performance or e-glass for cruising. The HH 52 retains many of the interior styling elements but introduces significant enhancements, including new interior designs and an island galley counter. Inspired by the HH 44's hybrid power system, massive solar capacity, and single-level living, the HH 52 reimagines its layout to optimize functionality and comfort.

Design

One of the standout features of the HH 52 is the sleek cabin rooftop, designed to accommodate up to 4.9 kilowatts of solar panels. This extensive solar array covers the elongated coach roof, providing additional shade and weather protection. The main traveler and its lines have been integrated into the coach roof, freeing up space in the cockpit. Large forward-opening windows enhance ventilation and light.

The HH 52 supports an Eco-Drive parallel hybrid diesel-electric motor system, charging a substantial lithium battery package. The rig design is optimized by lowering the gooseneck by nearly 600 millimeters, which increases the main sail area by approximately 10% without increasing the mast height. The carbon lodgeron beam has been extended by two feet, enhancing the size and efficiency of downwind sails. At a starting weight of just 11.5 tons, the HH 52 promises impressive performance and upwind capabilities, thanks to its deeper 60-millimeter dagger boards.

Helm

The HH 52 offers three optional helm positions, inspired by the HH 44. Twin aft swinging pedestal helms provide flexibility for viewing the sails from outboard or staying sheltered inboard. This configuration also enhances social interaction, with an L-shaped lounge setting and a transom bench seat that doubles as a helm seat when swung inboard.

Cockpit

The forward cockpit features all working hardware within easy reach and full visibility forward, catering to high-performance sailors. This setup is also available with optional tiller steering, appealing to sailing purists who prefer a tactile connection with the helm. The HH 52 is designed by catamaran legends Morelli and Melvin, ensuring top-tier engineering and performance.

The HH 52 is built to CE Class A standards for offshore cruising. It comes in two versions: the OC (Ocean Cruising) version with mini keels, an e-glass hull with carbon fiber reinforcement, and an alloy rig; and the SC (Sports Cruiser) version with an all-carbon hull, carbon dagger boards, and a carbon mast from Maastrum."

The HH44 is the latest model from HH Catamarans, continuing their award-winning tradition. This 44-foot catamaran is designed with performance and efficiency in mind, featuring a streamlined hull for superior sailing in light air. It weighs 9,500 kg with a maximum displacement of 15,000 kg, providing ample carrying capacity. The HH44 can achieve speeds up to 23 knots, emphasizing its performance capabilities.

Eco Drive System

A standout feature of the HH44 is its Eco Drive with parallel hybrid electric engines. This system includes hydro regeneration, allowing the boat to generate electricity while sailing. The parallel hybrid setup offers redundancy, enabling the boat to operate with either diesel engines or electric motors independently. This innovation ensures reliability and sustainability, catering to modern eco-conscious sailors.

Build and Material

The HH44 is built using advanced materials, with both models incorporating about 50% carbon fiber. The sports cruising version features daggerboards, carbon masts, and cross beams, enhancing performance. In contrast, the ocean cruising version uses mini keels and aluminum components, providing versatility for different sailing preferences. The boat's robust construction ensures durability and longevity.

Interior and Comfort

The interior of the HH44 is designed for luxury and comfort. It features spacious cabins with ample headroom and high-quality materials, including Coran waterfall counters and Mustang leather upholstery. The layout includes an owner's hull with a queen-sized bed, multiple hanging lockers, a washer and dryer, and a large shower.

The interior includes a modern galley with a four-burner induction stove, convection oven, and a large sink, along with a high-quality water purification system. The saloon offers a cozy space for dining or relaxing, with the ability to convert the table into a bed for added flexibility. Large safari-style windows provide panoramic views and natural ventilation. The owner’s cabin features hotel-style, high-comfort mattresses, and a spacious shower with ventilation, offering both luxury and practicality.

Technology and Systems

The HH 44 features a state-of-the-art digital switching system called Power Plex, which allows for control of all the boat's electrical loads via a touchscreen interface. This eliminates the need for a traditional breaker panel, saving space and simplifying maintenance. The system can also be accessed through mobile devices, enabling the captain to adjust lighting and systems from anywhere on board. The boat is equipped with RGB lighting, allowing the crew to customize the color and brightness of lights to suit different moods, from night sailing to festive occasions.

Comfort and Convenience

The HH 44 is equipped with features designed to maximize onboard comfort. The lighting system can be set to different modes, such as ""night sailing,"" which automatically adjusts interior and exterior lights for optimal conditions. Fold-down transoms and side boarding gates provide easy access for swimming or boarding from a dock. The diesel engine compartments are insulated for quiet operation, complementing the silent running of the electric motors for a peaceful onboard experience.

Conclusion

The HH 44 is a cutting-edge catamaran that combines eco-friendly performance, luxury, and smart design. Equipped with the latest technology and built with superior craftsmanship, it offers a comfortable, efficient sailing experience. Whether for sailors seeking sustainability or those looking for high-performance sailing, the HH 44 stands out as a game-changing vessel in the sailing world."

The suite includes a chill-out area, a dressing table, and an ultra-modern ensuite with twin sinks and a futuristic shower. VIP cabins continue this theme of sophistication with spacious layouts, high ceilings, and panoramic windows that can be tinted for privacy. Each cabin is thoughtfully equipped with luxurious amenities, including pop-up TVs, high-quality storage, and large ensuite bathrooms.

Unique Family and Entertainment Areas

Advanced Helm Station and Dual Navigation

The Hylas H48 is a high-performance, bluewater cruiser, meticulously crafted for serious sailors who value stability, comfort, and robust engineering. With accolades from Cruising World and Sail Magazine, this yacht has earned recognition for its build quality and advanced onboard systems. The H48 combines classic style with modern technology, ideal for couples or small crews ready to take on extended voyages or ocean crossings.

Hull and Performance: Built for Stability

The H48 features a medium displacement hull at 42,000 pounds, offering a balanced and stable ride, even in challenging conditions. Its center cockpit layout enhances safety and visibility, while the yacht’s 316 stainless steel hardware, including standing rigging and pulpit, underscores Hylas’s commitment to quality and durability. Designed for offshore cruising, the H48 provides reliable, quiet performance, excelling in varied sea states.

Cockpit and Sail Handling: Engineered for Shorthanded Sailing

The H48’s center cockpit is strategically designed for ease of handling and short-handed sailing. The push-button controls for the genoa, coupled with a self-tacking staysail, make maneuvering straightforward. With in-mast furling for the mainsail and lines led back to the cockpit, crew members can control the sails without leaving the cockpit, ensuring safety and simplicity for both novice and experienced sailors.

Interior Layout: Light-Filled and Spacious

The salon is characterized by wraparound windows that flood the space with natural light. High ceilings and large hatches provide an airy, open feel, while the interior woodwork, crafted from solid teak, offers a touch of elegance. The salon includes a convertible dining area and a hideaway TV, making it a comfortable space for relaxation. Moving forward, the VIP cabin offers a generous berth and ample storage, with options for customization based on owner preferences.

Galley and Master Suite: Practical and Comfortable

The H48’s walk-through galley provides abundant countertop space, a gimbaled stove, top- and side-opening fridge/freezer units, and extensive storage. This setup ensures easy meal prep, even in rough seas. The master suite, located aft, features a queen-size bed, numerous storage lockers, and an ensuite head with a separate shower. The suite’s layout optimizes comfort and privacy, making it ideal for long stays aboard.

Advanced Systems and Engine Room: Thoughtfully Designed

One of the H48’s standout features is its meticulously organized engine room, accessible from multiple points, allowing for easy maintenance. The Yanmar 75-horsepower engine, coupled with a saildrive, provides reliable power. A four-tank fuel system, managed through a manifold, allows onboard fuel polishing, an asset for extended passages. The well-arranged electrical panel and color-coded wiring exemplify the attention to detail that earned the H48 the “Best Systems” award from Sail Magazine.

Conclusion

With its high-quality construction, practical layout, and advanced systems, the Hylas H48 is a superb choice for serious cruisers seeking a capable, comfortable, and easy-to-handle yacht for bluewater adventures."

Launched in 2021, this vessel combines traditional craftsmanship with modern amenities, making it a perfect choice for both experienced sailors and newcomers. With its beautiful design and impressive specifications, the IP 439 showcases the best that Island Packet has to offer.

Exterior Features and Design

The IP 439 boasts a striking ivory hull paired with camel-tan nonskid, contributing to its classic aesthetic. Notable features include electric furlers for the jib and reacher, a robust Max prop, and a generous 1,000 amp hours of battery power. The integrated swim platform enhances accessibility, making it easy to enjoy the water, while stainless steel lifelines and handrails ensure safety. The boat's carbon composite brow reduces maintenance while providing an elegant appearance. With a 65-pound mantis anchor and a 350-foot high-test chain, the IP 439 is well-equipped for anchoring.

Luxurious Interior

Stepping below deck, the IP 439 welcomes occupants with a warm sapelli interior complemented by ivory headliners and Corian countertops. The galley features modern appliances, including a propane stove and a microwave, alongside ample storage for provisions and utensils. A well-placed washer and dryer unit adds convenience for extended cruising. The layout emphasizes natural light, with large hatches and portlights creating a bright and airy atmosphere throughout the living spaces.

Accommodations and Comfort

J/45
Period of manufacture
from 2021",https://itboat.com/models/12232-j-boats-j-45,"J/Boats J/45 Overview

The J/Boats J/45 is the latest flagship in the J/Boats cruising line, blending performance and comfort in a sleek, modern design. Known for their racing pedigree, J/Boats have designed the J/45 to cater to cruising enthusiasts while maintaining the brand’s renowned sailing characteristics.

Sailing Experience

The J/45 is designed to excel under sail. Sailing upwind in a moderate breeze, the boat consistently makes around 7.5 knots while pointing high, showcasing its impressive performance capabilities. The J/45 maintains J/Boats' DNA with a single rudder and excellent handling characteristics, making it enjoyable and responsive to sail.

Equipped with a large asymmetric spinnaker and other performance-oriented options, the J/45 can match true wind speeds in downwind conditions. The boat’s balance and stability, even in a leftover swell, highlight its versatility and performance potential.

Exterior Design

The J/45 features a sleek, aggressive bow shape with a long bow sprit option, allowing for larger downwind sails. The deck layout is clean and functional, with grippy non-slip surfaces and a practical toe rail. The sail locker is spacious, providing ample storage for sails and gear, with easy access to the anchor locker.

The boat includes a removable inner forestay, allowing for the use of a staysail in stronger winds. The German mainsheet system and inboard genoa tracks ensure optimal sail trim and performance. The cockpit is spacious, with long benches and a fixed table, making it ideal for both sailing and relaxation.

Interior Comfort

The interior of the J/45 is designed for comfort and practicality. The oak joinery, crafted by a specialist carpentry firm, creates a warm and inviting atmosphere. The galley is generous, with extensive storage and a large fridge/freezer combination. The saloon features comfortable seating and a large table that can convert into an extra berth.

The navigation station is well-equipped, with ample storage and easy access to electronics. The J/45 offers both two-cabin and three-cabin layouts, with the two-cabin version providing a spacious owner’s suite forward and a large aft cabin. The heads are well-appointed, with separate shower compartments and high-quality fixtures.

Practicality and Storage

Practicality is a key feature of the J/45. The boat offers abundant storage throughout, from the deep lockers in the galley and saloon to the dedicated tech room/workspace in the aft section. This area can be used for storing sails, equipment, or as a work area, providing flexibility for long-term cruising.

The boat's design includes secure handholds and fiddles, ensuring safety and stability while moving around the interior. The J/45 also features a generous payload capacity, allowing for extensive provisioning without compromising performance.

Conclusion

The J/45 by J/Boats is a testament to the brand’s commitment to performance and comfort. Combining a sleek design with practical features and a luxurious interior, the J/45 is well-suited for both racing enthusiasts and cruising couples. With its excellent sailing characteristics and thoughtful design, the J/45 is poised to be a popular choice in the performance cruiser market."

Known for its sailing races, the American shipyard introduced the 40-foot J121 in late 2017. In 2018 the J121 was named Yacht «of the Year in Britain» and the USA.

The exterior and interior design

Traditionally designed by the Johnston family, the J121 developed the success of the 120th model launched in 1995. With external similarities (overall length, width, draft), the J121 is a completely different boat. Displacement has been reduced by a ton, the waterline has been increased by a meter, the area of the sails (and these are the other sails) carried by the Carbon Rangout with removable boom. The cockpit became open, two handwheels appeared. The cockpit's gigarette wiring remained in the cockpit, but now it is more comfortable to work with this gear. The interior layout is similar: an L-shaped galley on the left, a navigating table on the right, and separate berths in the front of the cabin on the sides. The only cabin is aft. In 120, there was still a forward cabin, but in 121, it is no longer there, and the latrine is moved aft.

Amenities on board

Given the sporty nature of the boat, there are no facilities in the usual cruiser sense. But during an offshore race after watch you can cook and relax.

Features

The monotype J121 is the first yacht of the shipyard with water ballast. There are two 380l tanks on board, which can be used to compensate for the lack of crew weight in the open, as the boat was planned to control a small (2-5 people) crew.

Swimming area

In the world of racing, 40 feet is a serious length. The J121 was designed for short offshore races such as Fastnet or Middle Sea Race and so on. And the calculation proved to be true: the J121 has recently collected an impressive luggage of medals."

The J/122 set new standards for 40-foot «dual-purpose»yachts, suitable for full cruising as well as for racing, whether coastal or offshore. The boat is optimized for IRC handicap racing, but is also a fully equipped cruiser. The very small 40 foot displacement, large sailing area and low centre of gravity combined with very easy handling have made the boat competitive in racing with both low winds on smooth water and strong winds on waves.
Even in a long race, a yacht can only be driven by two people. A curious detail: the yacht is equipped with a so-called «coastal handrail». For long distance cruising it is installed behind the wheelhouse, closing the cockpit and making the stay on board safer. Before the race, it can be removed together with the heavy elements (stove, refrigerator, gas cylinders) that are unnecessary in the race and stay on the shore.

In 2010, the J/95 collected a bunch of awards from American yachting magazines in various categories. The main advantage of this boat is the lifting heavy keel (it's not a keel yacht, but a compromise), which is installed as usual. Such design entails a lot of advantages: the main thing among them is the possibility to walk confidently on a yacht in shallow water areas and to approach and moor quietly near shallow shores. This greatly enhances the use of the vessel.
As it should be done by modern vessels, J/95 is built according to the most modern technologies with the use of vacuum infusion. The power structure of the hull is very carefully worked out that gives grounds to hope for its high durability.

The J/80 is a fairly large yacht, suitable for sailing and racing outside of enclosed waters and bays. This sports projectile has phenomenal stability due to the very high proportion of lead ballast in the displacement of the yacht - almost 50%. The energy structure of the yacht is also quite high due to its large sailing area (especially with the spinnaker installed), which is why the J/80 is so fast.
She is very sensitive on the rudder and is able to catch the slightest gusts of wind, and in a strong enough wind to go almost with the speed of the wind itself.

Long Island 85
Period of manufacture
from 2014",https://itboat.com/models/4799-jfa-yachts-long-island-85,"JFA Yachts Long Island 85 Overview

The JFA Yachts Long Island 85 is a remarkable sailing catamaran that combines luxury, space, and advanced design to create an unparalleled cruising experience. With a nearly 40-foot beam and expansive living areas, this yacht is designed for those who seek both performance and comfort on the open sea.

Expansive Outdoor Spaces

As you board the Long Island 85, the sheer size of the yacht becomes immediately apparent. The large starboard sugar scoop provides easy access to the boat, leading you across the impressive 40-foot beam, which features a tender lift platform for seamless deployment of the tender. The walkways are wide and unobstructed, with flush-mounted hatches that enhance both safety and aesthetics.

Moving forward, the bow offers an enormous trampoline space, perfect for lounging and enjoying the views. The design cleverly incorporates shaded areas, allowing for comfortable relaxation under the sun. Additionally, the bow provides direct access to the primary suite via exterior stairs, as well as two sun pads that offer an incredible vantage point for taking in the surroundings.

Luxurious Interior

Stepping inside the salon, the first thing you notice is the open, airy feel, thanks to the fully retractable doors that blend indoor and outdoor living. The interior is tastefully appointed with a unique, comfortable flooring material and ample seating. A central navigation station allows for full control of the yacht, while a large dinette and hidden TV create a cozy yet sophisticated living space. The salon also features a small bar area with an ice maker, perfect for entertaining.

Spacious Accommodations

The Long Island 85 boasts multiple luxurious cabins, each thoughtfully designed for comfort and privacy. The starboard hull houses a VIP suite complete with a work area, TV, and ensuite bathroom. The adjacent galley is equipped with high-end appliances, including gas burners, an oven, a commercial dishwasher, and a refrigerator. Forward in the starboard hull, the crew quarters offer dual bunks, a washer and dryer, and a private bathroom.

The port hull features additional guest accommodations, including a spacious suite with a queen-sized bed, TV, and ensuite bathroom. Midship, an innovative layout includes a cabin with three berths, providing flexible sleeping arrangements for guests or crew.

Luxurious Primary Suite

The primary suite is a true standout, occupying the full beam of the yacht and offering an extraordinary level of luxury. The suite includes a workstation, ample seating, and a bed surrounded by large windows that flood the space with natural light. A private staircase leads directly from the suite to the bow’s outdoor seating area. The ensuite bathroom is equally impressive, featuring a walk-in shower with a rain head, a private water closet, dual vanities, and extensive storage.

Flybridge and Upper Helm

A spiral staircase leads to the flybridge, where the upper helm is located. All lines are routed back to the helm station, ensuring ease of operation. The flybridge also offers plenty of seating and a large table for outdoor dining, making it an ideal spot for socializing while enjoying panoramic views.

Conclusion

The JFA Yachts Long Island 85 is an extraordinary vessel that combines blue water performance with luxurious comfort. From its expansive outdoor spaces to its meticulously designed interiors, this yacht offers an exceptional cruising experience for those who demand the best in both style and functionality."

Exterior and Interior Design

In 2019 the JPK yard's range was enriched by a new sports keel monotype 1030 (the younger sister of the 1080 model). The boat can be described in three words - performance, ergonomics and functionality. At the same time it is designed for racing, but not without a spectacular appearance and comfort for the team.

Amenities on board

The cockpit is arranged ascetically: two benches, a tiller and two pairs of winches. Inside there is a small galley, dining area and a bathroom. One cabin is located forward and another aft. Two additional berths are in the dining area.

Features

The JPK 1030 is aimed at professional yachtsmen. The keel is equipped with water ballast and during the transition the crew can adjust the weight of the water, which allows to adjust the yacht to the specific weather conditions. The control is designed to be handled by both a small crew and one person.

Swimming area

The boat is certified to go out to sea and meets IRC standards."

The KC40 is today only a concept of an ultra-light speed sailing yacht, the details of which are very little known. She weighs only 4.5 tons, which is an incredible low weight for a 40-footer. For increase of stability designers suggest to apply water ballast - for its storage tanks in capacity of 750 litres on each board are provided.
The power structure of the boat is amazing - almost 25 square meters per ton of displacement. To control such a projectile you will need a very experienced crew with strong nerves.

The K73 was designed to be a racing yacht with high speed over a distance, but with the same level of crew comfort that is common to 70ft yachts. The impressive performance - for example, the power structure of the boat exceeds 15 square meters per tonne of displacement - and the careful hydrodynamics of the hull guarantee excellent performance in various weather conditions. The enclosure section is made of unidirectional carbon fibre to absorb stresses in critical areas. To improve aerodynamic performance, a wide Park Avenue type geek is used in sailing equipment.
There are two interior layouts to choose from: the owner«'s cabin, with a»luxurious aft owner's cabin and large volumes for provisions, and the charter-racing one, designed for serious regattas. The cockpit, as he relies on this type of yacht, is divided into two parts: the steering «and» tuning«cockpit, the soft»seats, the fridge and the table, of course.

The K43 looks as aggressive as the previous model, К33. This is a lightweight high-speed sailing yacht optimized for both sharp and full courses in medium winds. The yacht is distinguished by a rare feature of a lay-out - the forward (owner's) cabin has a separate bathroom: a toilet on one board and a shower on another.
The yacht's cockpit is open aft and well planned, especially for racing. There are six winches in the cockpit, but it will not be possible to manage it alone - it is impossible to work with stayshelf winches from the helmsman's seat. This yacht is created not for serene family pastime, but for active, adventurous and demanding yachtsmen who love speed and know how to squeeze everything out of the boat.

K33",https://itboat.com/models/2183-kelly-k33,"Kelly K33 Overview

The K33 was the very first Kelly Yachts boat. Almost immediately after her appearance, she received the Millenium Yacht Design award for the best design of a sailing yacht no longer than 10 metres long. In fact, it is difficult to find another sailing boat of the same length, with three full-size cabins and showers, with a height of more than 190 centimeters. The whole secret is contained in the original layout: a similar gangway to the salon is shifted to the right of the DP, and on its traditional place is equipped with a garage stand.
The yacht was originally designed «from the hull by»drawing a fast and light hull with a small area of wet surface. Its main advantage is the absence of water lines: even at the heel of the yacht, the water lines remain symmetrical, which significantly reduces the yacht's yawning and her tendency to broach. The design and production technology of the hull is quite modern: manual lamination of the sandwich structure using vinyl epoxy resin as a bonding agent.

The Kinetic KC 62 is a high-performance carbon catamaran built by Kinetic in South Africa. Designed for speed and comfort, this yacht is a perfect blend of racing capabilities and luxury, making it an ideal choice for those who enjoy both thrilling sailing and the comforts of a blue-water cruiser.

Exterior Design and Rigging

The KC 62's exterior is crafted with extensive use of carbon fiber, ensuring a lightweight yet sturdy build. The yacht features a carbon mast and boom, with the mast being deck-stepped for enhanced structural integrity. The rigging setup includes a Southern Spars carbon mast and North Sails 3Di endurance sails, specifically designed for long-lasting performance in blue-water conditions. The mainsail is controlled via a traveler system, allowing precise adjustments to the sail angle without altering its shape, a feature typically found on racing yachts.

Interior and Accommodation

The interior of the Kinetic KC 62 is as impressive as its exterior, offering a comfortable and luxurious living space. The main salon provides a 360-degree view, making it the central hub for onboard activities. The port hull is dedicated to the owner, featuring a spacious master cabin with a forward-facing bed and a private ensuite bathroom. The starboard hull houses two additional guest cabins, each with its own bathroom, offering ample space for guests. The design emphasizes lightweight construction, with carbon fiber used throughout, including in the cabinetry and even the carbon toilet in the guest cabins.

Performance and Sailing Experience

The KC 62 is built for speed, with its design allowing it to reach impressive sailing speeds. The catamaran is equipped with centerboards that can be retracted for shallow-water navigation or lowered for improved upwind performance. Optional daggerboards are available, providing even deeper draft and enhanced performance. The boat is highly responsive, making it a joy to sail, whether racing or cruising. During a test sail, the KC 62 easily reached speeds of over 10 knots with just 12 knots of wind, demonstrating its exceptional performance capabilities.

Engine and Additional Features

Powered by twin 80-horsepower Yanmar engines, the KC 62 offers reliable motoring capabilities when needed. The engines are paired with folding propellers and an overdrive function, providing a cruising speed of around 9.5 knots at 2100 RPM. Despite its performance-oriented design, the KC 62 does not compromise on comfort and amenities. The yacht is equipped with fishing rods, a full suite of navigation electronics, and optional upgrades like an additional steering wheel, making it versatile for various sailing adventures.

Conclusion

The Kinetic KC 62 is a remarkable catamaran that seamlessly combines the speed and agility of a racing yacht with the comfort and luxury of a cruiser. Whether you're looking to push the limits on the racecourse or enjoy a leisurely cruise with all the modern conveniences, the KC 62 delivers an exceptional sailing experience."

The Kraken 50 is the brainchild of Dick Beaumont, a seasoned cruiser who sought to create the ultimate sailing yacht. This vessel is designed to combine strength, resilience, and elegance, making it perfect for long voyages and challenging conditions.

Exterior Design and Deck Layout

The hull lines of the Kraken 50 were crafted by Kiwi designer Kevin Dibley, featuring an integrated keel and a single rudder protected by a skeg. This design enhances safety and stability, reducing the risk of keel loss in the event of a collision. The yacht's ""Zero Keel"" incorporates a lead bulb molded into the keel for maximum efficiency without bolts.

The exterior of the Kraken 50 boasts clean lines with an uncluttered forward deck, enhancing both aesthetics and functionality. The center cockpit is spacious, equipped with a drop-down table ideal for social gatherings. The cockpit's high coaming provides safety and comfort, with six winches strategically placed for ease of sailing.

Interior Layout and Features

The saloon of the Kraken 50 is designed for comfort and socialization, offering ample light and high-quality craftsmanship with elegant finishes. The forward-facing navigation station features a unique chair, making it an excellent spot for long watches or route planning.

Accommodations are flexible, with configurations ranging from four to six berths, and options for additional amenities like a laundry machine. The heads are spacious and well-appointed, ensuring comfort during long passages.

The galley is designed in a true galley style, providing extensive bench space and storage. It includes modern electric appliances with an induction cooktop, making cooking safe and convenient.

Rigging and Sailing Performance

The Kraken 50 features an ample and flexible solent rig, allowing all sail changes to be made from the cockpit. This rig can be set up in a butterfly configuration for efficient downwind sailing without the need for a spinnaker, making it ideal for world circumnavigation.

Engine Room and Technical Specifications

The engine room is clean and spacious, facilitating easy service and maintenance. It houses a Yanmar diesel engine, an Onan generator, and a large water maker, all essential for long-distance cruising. The meticulous installation of all components ensures reliability and ease of access.

Conclusion

The Kraken 50 is a robust, well-built yacht that offers a delightful sailing experience. Its thoughtful design and high-quality construction make it an excellent choice for anyone looking to embark on long voyages or navigate challenging waters."

Maestro 40 became the new flagship of the company, in which the latter has invested all its design findings. The original goal was to create a yacht that is easy to operate, comfortable, safe and very fast, with modern lines and quality equipment. The designer was asked to abandon the trendy concept of ULDB (Ultra Light Displacement Boat) and make a yacht of medium displacement for its length (all for the sake of reliability), but which would have the same performance as a light racing yacht. This was achieved in no small part due to the keel with a very low centre of gravity, as well as the U-shaped stern bypasses, which increase the static stability and give the yacht good opportunities for surfing on a tailwind wave.
The boat has modern superstructure lines, large interior space suitable for both racing and long family voyages, and the large rudder pen area makes it very maneuverable.

Malo 43 is one of the best models of Scandinavian yachts, characterized by excellent sailing qualities, reliable construction and excellent interior with high quality woodwork. The yacht is very manoeuvrable on the move - a characteristic feature of almost all Malo yachts, such a requirement of the North European market.
Unlike the mass European 40-footer, the Malo 43 has an extremely high level of customization. In fact, out of the 60 Malo 43 built there are no two identical yachts - the layout of the yacht can be adapted to any customer's requirements (of course within the limits of reasonable). Other yacht builders usually only start with a yacht over 70-80 feet in length.

The Malo 37 is an almost classic yacht that looks quite different from most European sailing boats. It is a typical North European cruiser with a developed superstructure, large width and well protected cockpit. The large width of the boat means good stability and the ability to carry advanced sailing weapons, in addition, the yacht becomes much more spacious inside. The requirements for high manoeuvrability (Scandinavian buyers often face the problem of navigating in narrow fairways of local archipelagoes) and ease of operation were important.
What is unusual is that the Malo 37 can be produced in three different hulls that differ in the shape of the stern: it can have a classic transom, a modern transom with a reverse eave and a transom with an integrated swim platform.

The Malo 47 Classic has become the new flagship of the shipyard, and despite its relatively small size, it is positioned as a true long-range blue water cruiser designed to sail at any range (up to around the world) and in all waters, including the Arctic. Every detail of the yacht has been examined from the perspective of a yachtsman who has set out for a difficult and long range voyage. Much attention has been paid to the natural light of the salon and cabins, and in terms of safety the yacht is equipped with a large number of external and internal rails.
The reliability of the yacht is guaranteed by the assembly process unusual for today - first sections and decks are glued together and only then the furniture is assembled. This technology is much more expensive and time-consuming, but the reliability and durability of the yacht becomes much higher.
For navigation in northern waters the yacht is equipped with unusual for sailing vessels devices: the windshield of the cockpit is equipped with an antifreezer, in the cockpit the heating pipes are brought out. Even in the Arctic, a watchman covered by a powerful bimini will feel warm and comfortable.

Malo 40 was the successor of the very popular model Malo 39, which for 10 years of production was built in more than 90 copies. The new yacht has been built with two principles in mind: «work - do not touch and the» more«the better. The successful hull shape was decided not to be changed, only a slightly sharper nose and a slightly wider stern for better stability. The length of the waterline grew by 60 centimetres and the sailing area by almost two square metres.
The result is a very comfortable and spacious yacht with good sailing characteristics, made with exceptionally high quality.

The Maxi SM40 is an example of a pure racing boat, designed as a strict monotype (one design). Designed for serious racing (e.g. match racing), the boat has impressive features, such as a 68% weight gain in displacement, a record for keel yachts. The energy efficiency of 20 square meters per tonne is also impressive. Very serious device for strong guys.
It is no wonder that one of the first SM40 customers was the BMW Oracle team - current owner of the «America's Cup.

The Maxi 1300 is the youngest model of the shipyard, designed, like all the previous ones, by the famous Pelle Peterson. In creating it, this famous racer tried to combine two things - high speed performance (it's hard to expect anything else from an Olympic champion) with traditional Swedish reliability and comfort. According to journalists who have tested the boat on the move, the designer has succeeded - the yacht is said to have the comfort and reliability of a Najad combined with the performance at the level of Grand Soleil. Lightweight, spacious, comfortable to be operated by just one person, this yacht with its elegant appearance will be the pride of its owner both at sea and in her berth."

The Maxus 24 is Northman's second oldest model: it followed shortly after the company's firstborn -... Maxus 33. This yacht still fits into the permissible auto-sized limits and can be transported in a trailer behind a passenger car. When designing the boat, the designers tried to find the best compromise between performance, seaworthiness and habitability. Inside, the yacht is unusually spacious and comfortable for a 24-footer: there are a total of six beds (including the salon), a well-equipped galley and latrines. The dodgers of the hull have modern lines with wide aft. The open cockpit can be closed from the stern with a removable can, and the cockpit coamings are very comfortable for sitting on the opening. The 24-ca is one of the best boats in the shipyard and can leave even larger boats behind the stern."

The Moody DS48 is a groundbreaking yacht designed to combine luxury, comfort, and high performance. Built with precision and innovation, the DS48 offers a unique sailing experience with its impressive features and thoughtful design.

Innovative Exterior Features

The Moody DS48 showcases a forward dinette area, perfect for enjoying privacy in a crowded harbor. The table can be easily dismounted and stored in a spacious locker, which also accommodates fenders and other essential items. Behind the dinette, a large sunbathing area provides relaxation space, with hatches below allowing light and air into the master cabin.

The deck saloon, a signature feature of all Moody yachts, offers a 360° view through a one-piece windshield and six slim pillars that do not obstruct the view. The cockpit, located on a lower level, provides maximum protection and a safe, secure feeling. It features tables on both sides, ample seating space, and two large storage lockers beneath the benches. Additionally, the wet bar in the cockpit is perfect for outdoor cooking and entertaining.

Spacious and Functional Interior

Stepping into the saloon, the first noticeable feature is the wide galley that spans the entire width of the boat. It is equipped with modern appliances, including a fridge, dishwasher, oven with three burners, and the option for additional freezers or refrigerators. The saloon also features a large U-shaped sofa with a high-low table that can be converted into a lounge area.

A significant change in this model is the replacement of the traditional nav station with a table, though the boat can still be controlled from the saloon via the autopilot. This layout provides a seamless one-level living experience without the need to cross any steps.

Comfortable and Versatile Cabins

The Moody DS48 offers three cabins. On the starboard side, there is a bedroom with an adjacent bath, while the port side can be configured either as another bedroom with a bath or a multifunction room, which could include a walk-in closet instead of a bathroom.

The master bedroom features a spacious bath with a standing-height shower, plenty of storage, and a wide bed accessible from both sides. Numerous windows and hatches ensure ample light and fresh air, offering a perfect view outside.

Conclusion

The Moody DS48 is an exceptional yacht that combines innovative design, luxurious comfort, and practical functionality. Its unique features, such as the forward dinette, wide galley, and versatile cabin options, make it a brilliant choice for sailing enthusiasts."

Period of manufacture

The world premiere of the Moody DS41 took place at an exhibition in Düsseldorf in 2020.

Exterior and interior design

The new 41 has extended the range of the Deck Salon yachts and inherited the shape from her sisters, Moody 45 and 54. The superstructure received a streamlined shape and extensive glazing, which provides a 360-degree view from the cabin. The interiors were created in the style of modern minimalism in order to provide maximum free space.

Amenities on board

The deck has two separate lounge areas: a cockpit with a table and a lounge at the bow. The saloon has a dining area and a comfortable functional galley, while the two cabins occupy the lower deck. The lower deck has a bathroom and pantry by default, but as an option the latter can be replaced by another garage.

Features

The designers have thought about the boat well: two control stations provide better visibility, the gig is much higher than a human being's height and does not interfere with free movement in the cockpit, and if necessary, you can always climb the roof. Also thanks to the deck salon, the 12.52-meter boat offers comfort comparable to that of larger vessels.

Swimming area

The yacht is designed for long journeys in the Mediterranean and can also cover transatlantic distances. At the same time it is quite easy to cope with a small crew."

The Najad 395 is a significant new model from the esteemed Swedish boatyard, Najad, marking their first new hull and deck design in nearly ten years. Designed by Farr and Ken Freivokh, the 395 showcases the durability and robustness Najad is renowned for. It features solid laminates with thick vinylester hull and deck, including a grid structure that effectively absorbs keel and rig loads.

The design incorporates modern touches like a spoiler design on fixed sprayhood windows and a spacious, protected cockpit, along with a swimming platform, catering to modern yachting preferences.

Sailing and Handling

The Najad 395 is engineered for excellent sailing performance and handling, adhering to Najad's tradition of building seaworthy and reliable yachts. The single rudder design, preferred for its protection and maneuverability, ensures efficient handling. The twin helms in the aft cockpit model create a walk-through passageway to the cockpit, while the center cockpit model features a single wheel. These design choices ensure the boat can handle various sea conditions comfortably and safely, providing a smooth sailing experience for the crew.

Interior and Comfort

The interior of the Najad 395 blends traditional Swedish craftsmanship with a modern touch, offering options for either white oak or another wood finish. The aft cockpit version includes a large aft double cabin, while the forward cabin features a split berth.

The Neel 52 is the latest addition to the Neel trimaran lineup, replacing the 51 after an 8-year run. Known for its impressive sailing capabilities, the Neel 52 promises to uphold and exceed its predecessor's performance.

Interior

The interior of the Neel 52 is a marvel of space and layout. The saloon concept merges the cockpit and the saloon, creating an expansive living area. The main deck houses the owner's cabin, a large galley, a nav station, and a watch station, all offering panoramic views. The design significantly reduces weight, addressing balance issues from the previous model. Unique features include a walk-in closet, a vanity area, and a full laundry setup with a domestic-size washer and dryer. The four-cabin version provides ample accommodation, but configurations for five or six cabins and crew quarters are also available.

Engine Room

The engine room on the Neel 52 is a standout feature. Located aft, it offers extensive space for maintenance and servicing. The 110 horsepower Yanmar engine is easily accessible, along with the generator and other essential systems. The weight distribution has been optimized, with the engine and other heavy components positioned to improve the boat's balance and performance. The sail locker or toy storage area is vast, capable of housing various equipment, including bikes, paddle boards, and dinghies, with ample headroom.

Helm

The Neel 52 maintains a single helm station, accessible from both the cockpit and the side. This design consolidates all lines to one area, enhancing ease of handling. The flybridge area is spacious, providing ample room for solar panels. While there are plans to introduce a second helm for better windward sailing, the current setup is effective for maneuvering in port. The helm layout includes reefing lines, head sheets, and boom angle controls, making it easy to handle the sails.

Conclusion

The Neel 52 marks a significant step forward for Neel trimarans, combining performance with luxury. This first model has already garnered attention, with 25 units sold shortly after its launch, surpassing the 40 units sold of the 51 over 8 years. As the brand continues to improve finish quality and after-sales service, the Neel 52 stands out as a promising choice for the future."

A year after the launch of the successful Neel 51 in 2018, the French have updated their line with the equally successful 47th model.

Exterior and Interior Design

The boat owes its futuristic look to the talented designer Marc Lombard, who was personally involved in the project. The Neel 47 sailing cruise trimaran is easily recognisable among classmates «»thanks to its smooth hull rims and strict superstructure with slightly bevelled glass. The interiors of the boat are in Mediterranean style.

Comfort on board

The cockpit is conventionally divided into two seating areas: living room with a couple of sofas and dining room. There is plenty of space and there is still free passage in the middle, which is not surprising as the boat is 8.23 meters wide. The superstructure has a small coffee table with a sofa and behind it is the kitchen. It is noteworthy that the owner's cabin is located on the main deck and each guest room in the floats has its own access.

Features

The design of the trimaran is heavier than the catamaran, but with narrower bridges it is stronger and more stable. For a better view, the engineers took the control post to a separate semi-floor. All the ends were taken out, so a small crew can handle the boat.

Swimming area

The boat is ready for transatlantic crossings and will provide the necessary comfort for the whole company in a long autonomous voyage."

The Neel 65 Evolution is the flagship of the Neel trimaran range, boasting a length of 20 meters and a beam of 12 meters. This impressive multihull yacht is designed with three distinct deck levels, offering expansive spaces for both relaxation and navigation. With its innovative layout and advanced sailing capabilities, the Neel 65 Evolution is built for those who seek luxury and performance on the open sea.

Flybridge and Exterior Layout

The flybridge of the Neel 65 Evolution is a standout feature, offering two helm stations that provide excellent visibility and control while docking. The helm stations are strategically positioned to allow full control of the vessel's systems, including the three primary winches located at the mast foot. Behind the helm, the flybridge transforms into a social hub with twin teak tables and a sunbed on the starboard side, perfect for lounging and enjoying the views.

Main Deck and Interior Design

Stepping down to the main deck, the Neel 65 Evolution continues to impress with its versatile and spacious layout. The entrance to the main salon, or ""cocoon,"" features a flexible door system that can be adjusted based on weather conditions. In favorable weather, the doors can be fully opened to merge the indoor and outdoor living spaces, creating a seamless flow between the galley, dining, and lounging areas.

The starboard side of the main deck features a comfortable cocktail area with sofas that offer panoramic views from the yacht's 12-meter beam. On the port side, a large chart table doubles as an office space, providing a functional area for navigation and work. Adjacent to the chart table is the entrance to the owner’s en suite cabin, which is located on the main deck and offers expansive views through large windows.

Cabins and Accommodations

The Neel 65 Evolution is designed to accommodate up to ten guests in five en suite cabins. The main deck houses the owner’s cabin, which offers full privacy and unobstructed views. The other cabins are located in the floats, each accessible through private sliding doors that ensure complete separation from the main living areas. The layout is designed to provide maximum comfort and privacy for all guests.

Engine Room and Technical Features

The engine room is centrally located in the main hull, below the waterline, to maintain the vessel’s stability and balance. This area houses the main engine, generator, and electrical systems, all positioned for optimal weight distribution. The trimaran also features a hydraulic dinghy garage capable of accommodating a 3.8-meter tender, along with two additional garages in the floats for storing kayaks, paddleboards, and scuba gear.

Conclusion

The Neel 65 Evolution is a masterpiece of design and engineering, offering a unique blend of luxury, space, and sailing performance. Built in La Rochelle, France, this trimaran is ideal for long-distance cruising or coastal exploration, providing a comfortable and stable platform for both adventure and relaxation."

430 Roma
Period of manufacture
from 2020",https://itboat.com/models/15425-neo-yachts-430-roma,"Neo 430 Roma Overview

The Neo 430 Roma is a performance cruiser designed by Giovanni Ceccarelli and built by Neo Yachts in Bari, Italy. It represents the culmination of seven years of collaboration between Paolo Semeraro and the Neo Yachts team, showcasing a yacht that bridges the gap between fast cruising and racing.

Construction and Design

The Neo 430 is built entirely from carbon fiber using the sandwich construction method. The use of infusion with epoxy resins results in a lightweight yet sturdy structure, with both the interior and exterior fully painted. The boat’s hull features sleek lines designed for both performance and stability. It has a long waterline but reduced wetted surface area, making it efficient under sail. The structural components of the boat, such as the carbon fiber inserts and integral furniture, contribute to its rigidity while maintaining a minimal weight.

Performance

As a performance cruiser, the Neo 430 is made for sailors who want speed without sacrificing comfort. Weighing just 5,800 kg with 2,900 kg of ballast, the boat boasts an impressive weight-to-ballast ratio, providing excellent stability. The sail plan features a large headsail and a smaller mainsail, optimizing the boat's power in light winds while maintaining balance in stronger conditions. The ""J"" measurement, the distance between the mast and the forestay, is designed to maximize the headsail’s effectiveness, contributing to its ability to sail efficiently at various angles.

Interior

Despite being a performance-focused yacht, the interior of the Neo 430 offers a high level of finish. The interior structures are painted with a glossy white finish, accented by carbon fiber elements. The galley is equipped with carbon fiber panels, offering both practicality and aesthetics. The yacht also features racing-inspired bunks with adjustable levels, providing comfort during offshore racing by keeping the crew's sleeping positions horizontal relative to the sea.

Sailing Experience

The Neo 430 excels both upwind and downwind, handling conditions such as the 2-meter waves experienced during testing with ease. Thanks to its heavy bulb keel and deep draft, it offers excellent stability, even in challenging seas. The steering is highly responsive, requiring delicate handling for smooth operation. The boat maintains strong upwind angles, making it ideal for competitive racing or fast cruising.

Cockpit and Deck Layout

The cockpit is designed for both racing and cruising, with a functional layout that allows easy movement of the crew. The helm features lightweight carbon fiber wheels, and the footrests can be adjusted to provide comfort when the boat is heeling. The folding carbon fiber table and ample seating make it a versatile space for socializing when at anchor, and the cockpit transitions smoothly from racing to relaxing mode.

Conclusion

The Neo 430 Roma is a finely tuned performance cruiser that delivers on both speed and comfort. With its advanced construction techniques, elegant interior, and exceptional sailing performance, it is an ideal choice for sailors who want a yacht that can excel in regattas while offering the comfort needed for extended cruising."

Period of manufacture
from 2022",https://itboat.com/models/15430-nordship-420-ds,"Nordship 420 DS Overview

The Nordship 420 DS, a Danish-built yacht, stands out for its bespoke craftsmanship and high-quality construction. This deck saloon yacht is not a mass-production model, with only around ten boats built annually, emphasizing its exclusivity and customizability.

Exterior Features and Design

Starting at the bow, the Nordship 420 DS features a short bowsprit that houses the anchor roller, accompanied by a bow thruster. The yacht has a relatively slim but high-volume hull, designed for proper cruising with a deep profile and a composite keel. This keel, made of fiberglass with a lead bomb and high-performance steel, boasts a low center of gravity, allowing for a taller mast and enhanced stability. The stern of the yacht includes a small skeg and a balanced single spade rudder, with a sugar scoop transom for easy access to the water or a dinghy.

Cockpit and Helm Station

The center cockpit of the Nordship 420 DS is designed for functionality and safety. It features a single large wheel on a solid pedestal, with all lines led aft, making it easy to handle. The helm station is equipped with powered winches for ease of sail handling. The cockpit itself is deep and secure, free from lines, making it ideal for families and providing a safe environment for children. The social cockpit area includes a large dining table that can be adjusted or removed to provide more space or handholds when needed.

Interior Layout and Amenities

Descending into the interior, the deck saloon layout offers 270-degree visibility, enhancing the open and airy feel. The saloon features customizable options, including a chart table and various seating arrangements.

The Nordship 380 DS was a further development of the ideas behind the model. Nordship 40 DS- the first modern model of the shipyard, which saw the light in 2007. Its main distinguishing feature was the huge cockpit, which for the first time in the company's history was divided into two parts: a worker «and a guest» room. The guest cockpit, as it is supposed, is completely free from winches and gear, but in it at a table can easily accommodate up to 8 people.
The interior layout is typical of North European yacht builders and aims at maximum comfort and privacy: in addition to the large dining «salon», there is also a small media «room»designed for viewing the large TV installed in it. A careful approach to the use of sub-deck space has given the designers the opportunity to fence off a small space inside the yacht that can be used as a locker or workshop.

The O-Yachts Class 4, a 46-foot catamaran offering a unique blend of performance, safety, and customization. With a focus on owner-dedicated yachts, O-Yachts provides various models ranging from 8 to 24 meters, ensuring options for every sailing enthusiast.

Design and Construction

One of the standout features of the Class 4 is its robust construction. The yacht is built with a carbon fiber crossbeam instead of traditional aluminum, utilizing 11 layers of carbon and hand lamination for enhanced strength and durability. This attention to detail ensures that the boat remains solid and noise-free, even in challenging sea conditions.

The Class 4 features a rotative carbon mast that allows for easier sail management, enabling the sailor to adjust sails without having to stop the boat. This innovative design reduces the need for crew movement, making it suitable for couples or single-handed sailors. The yacht’s performance is enhanced by its lightweight construction, which is critical for speed and agility on the water.

Performance and Safety Features

Performance and safety are paramount in the Class 4. The yacht is engineered to handle various weather conditions, providing peace of mind for long-distance cruising. Its design facilitates a balance between speed and ease of handling, making it accessible for less experienced sailors.

Key features include:

Weight Management: With a displacement of 7.5 tons, the Class 4 is designed for optimal performance while maintaining stability.
Safety Enhancements: The interior construction uses structural panels, ensuring that non-structural components contribute to the overall strength of the boat.
Innovative Design Choices: Owners can customize elements like the cockpit layout and mast type, ensuring the yacht meets their specific sailing preferences.
Interior Comfort and Customization

The interior of the Class 4 reflects a commitment to comfort and style. The layout is customizable, with multiple options available to suit individual preferences. Key highlights include:

Spacious Master Cabin: The master cabin features a wide berth and is designed for relaxation, with ample storage options and thoughtful finishes.
Functional Galley: The galley is well-appointed with modern appliances, allowing for convenient meal preparation while at sea.
Open Layout: The yacht emphasizes a sea view, ensuring that occupants enjoy the surrounding environment while aboard.
Conclusion

The O-Yachts Class 4 offers a compelling option for those seeking a performance-oriented catamaran that prioritizes safety and owner customization. Its innovative design, robust construction, and attention to detail make it a standout choice for both seasoned sailors and newcomers.

With a build time ranging from three months to a year, depending on the size and specifications, the Class 4 is a testament to O-Yachts' dedication to quality and customer satisfaction.

Introduced in 2013, Outremer 51 received a «facelift» in 2018 and after its premiere at the La Grande Moteur «home» boat show was voted Yacht of the Year by Voile et Moteur and Le Monde du Multicoque.

Exterior and interior design...

The Outremer 51 is a development of the 49th model of the French shipyard, which has an impressive collection of titles. Designed by Barreau/Neuman, the 51 remained almost the same in the third generation: a narrow, fast hull with powerful sailing arms. The changes affected the interior space (Darnet Design work) and further weight reduction of the boat. Now the «dry» 51st weighs a little more than 10 tons, that is, the declared speeds of about 20 knots are quite real.

Amenities on board

If the Outremer 51 calls with all its looks on the road, the interior decoration ensures that the road is not ascetic. The owner's family is allotted the entire left hull with a king-size bed aft and a shower in the nose. Guests are accommodated in the right hull in two cabins. Four-cabin «charter» versions are also available.

Features .

Outremer 51's sports DNA is visible at first sight. No flybridges, open cockpits or wide tanning areas. The values here are quite different: the optional rotating carbon mast, dinghies and signature tiller controls are what the understanding owner will enjoy.

Swimming area

The Outremer shipyard takes its customers' travel arrangements seriously. We offer courses on swimming planning, boat management skills and so on. So it is not a question of a boat at all - it is ready to go anywhere, rather, you should be ready for a real adventure."

The yacht handles well in various conditions, from flat water to choppy seas, making it an excellent choice for both casual and competitive sailing. The push-button controls and hydraulic furlers enhance ease of handling, allowing the yacht to be managed efficiently by a small crew or even single-handedly.

Deck Layout

The deck of the Oyster 595 is designed for both functionality and aesthetics. The helm area is equipped with essential controls for sail adjustments, making it easy to manage the yacht from one central location. The cockpit offers ample space for relaxation, protected by a well-designed spray hood. The side decks are wide and safe, with excellent grab rails and flush hatches for a clean look. The foredeck features a spacious sail locker, capable of storing an asymmetric sail, spare warps, and additional equipment. The integrated bow roller and hydraulic trailer add to the deck's practical design, enhancing both usability and safety.

Interior Comfort

Below deck, the Oyster 595 boasts a luxurious and spacious interior, finished with high-quality materials and meticulous attention to detail. The semi-raised saloon provides ample natural light, thanks to large hull port lights and opening coach roof windows. The galley is well-appointed, with abundant work surfaces, storage, and modern appliances, making it ideal for long passages. The aft owner's cabin is particularly impressive, offering a super yacht level of comfort with a large island berth, plenty of storage, and an en-suite head with a separate shower compartment. The forward guest cabins are equally well-designed, providing comfortable accommodation with excellent storage and natural light.

Advanced Systems

Oyster has equipped the 595 with advanced systems to ensure ease of operation and maintenance. The yacht features a C-Zone digital switching system, allowing for intuitive control of lighting, tank levels, and other systems via touch screens at the helm and nav station. The engine room is a model of efficiency, with all components neatly arranged for easy access. This includes a retractable bow thruster and an optional stern thruster, which together provide precise maneuverability, making docking in tight spaces straightforward and stress-free.

This sailboat with a central cockpit, designed by Humphreys Yacht Design, once was an entry-level model in the Oyster range. Oyster 565 became the first «pocket-sized» yacht for the British shipyard.

Exterior and interior design

Not just the central cockpit, but the crew will feel safe on deck, even in the open ocean.

By moving the control station to the centre, a spacious aft deck remains in place. The clients can ask to change the transom shape so that there is enough space for all toys on and in the storage compartment below. The swimming platform is available as an option for both types of transom.

And as for the interiors, the shipyard is very responsive to the client's requests.

Amenities on board

Three cabins are available by default to accommodate guests: a master aft and two twin cabins forward. The alternative layout (first for Oyster) is the exact opposite, with the master suite forward and one large cabin, which can be divided into two double cabins, if desired, aft.

It is also possible to equip another (fourth) cabin - there you can place an extra bed or use it as a service room and storage for diving equipment.

Features of Oyster 565

The model is available in several layouts and with different keel variants: ballast and swing sword-shaped centreboard, suitable for shallow water.

Cruising area

This sailing boat is for travelling with family and friends - without a professional crew. The certification in category A means reliable enough to go far from the shore. Young families and couples can go around the world on this sailboat."

The Pelagic 77 is a purpose-built aluminum schooner designed for extended expeditions in the harshest environments, including Antarctica and high-latitude regions. Created by designer Tony Castro in collaboration with adventurer Nicolás Ibáñez and renowned expedition leader Skip Novak, this 77-foot vessel is equipped for long-term autonomous voyages, supporting scientific research, film crews, and extreme adventurers in remote locations.

Design and Rigging

The Pelagic 77 features a twin-mast schooner rig, allowing for interchangeable mainsails and versatile sail configurations. With three headsails permanently rigged—a genoa, yankee, and storm staysail—the boat is prepared for any weather without the need to change sails mid-voyage. The manual sail handling system, unusual for a yacht of this size, is essential for the remote areas the Pelagic 77 operates in, where self-reliance is critical. The cockpit is highly functional, with ergonomic winches at standing height for safe and efficient sail management, even in rough seas.

Cockpit and Deck Features

The Pelagic 77’s cockpit is designed with safety and practicality in mind. It lacks traditional seating to allow crew members to work the winches comfortably without obstruction. The cockpit is also partially covered, providing shelter for the crew without requiring them to don full foul-weather gear. The deck layout includes extensive storage for life rafts and equipment, as well as a hydraulically lifted swim platform. The deck also features bomb-bay doors for deploying tenders, as well as a comprehensive anchoring system, including four lines to shore for stability in tight anchorages.

Interior and Expedition Support

The Pelagic 77’s interior is designed for both comfort and functionality during long expeditions. It features six symmetrical cabins with ample storage for personal gear and expedition equipment. The boat is equipped with heating, radiators, and ventilation systems to ensure a warm and cozy environment, even in freezing conditions. The enclosed pilothouse provides 360-degree visibility, allowing for safe navigation in ice-infested waters, while the spacious saloon and galley offer communal areas for dining, relaxing, and working on projects. The boat's extensive storage, including dedicated spaces for diving gear and scientific equipment, ensures self-sufficiency for months at sea.

Conclusion

The Pelagic 77 is a rugged and versatile expedition yacht, designed to operate autonomously in the world's most extreme environments. Its blend of practicality, safety, and comfort makes it the perfect vessel for adventurers, researchers, and filmmakers seeking long-range exploration in high latitudes."

Period of manufacture

As they say at the shipyard, the RM 1180 is a champion in creating emotions. Bright looks and colours, design content and excellent speed qualities make this yacht attractive for offshore yachtsmen who appreciate modern aesthetics.

Exterior and interior design

The project was created by Marc Lombard Design Group. Although Edouard Delamare Debouttville, the head of RM's engineering division, played one of the main roles in the concept development.

Amenities on board

Despite the sporty nature of the RM 1180, there is no shortage of space and comfort below deck. Natural light fills the living area thanks to the panoramic deckhouse glazing and large rectangular side windows. Certainly, three cabins, a well-equipped galley and a bathroom are a good base for a comfortable cruising or racing experience.

Features of RM 1180

The RM 1180's hull structure combines traditional marine plywood with epoxy resin. As a result, these materials provide the hull with lightness and durability. Based on the experience building IMOCA-type offshore racing yachts, the model has a reverse stem and a wide raised stern that makes it easier to glide. Further, the optimal sail plan allows managing the yacht with a minimum crew.

Cruising area

The yacht is definitely for ocean cruising. Based on her plans for the boat, the owner can choose between a standard, lift or twin keel. Accordingly, the RM 1180 draught will vary from 1.3 to 3.2m."

The Regina 49, as the flagship model of the company, continues to develop the ideas contained in the 43rd model. Great efforts have been made to create a yacht that is as reliable and durable as possible - for example, the hull has received a system of developed metal flora combined with the mast and engine supports. The connection of the bulkheads to the hull is not only laminated on both sides, but also supported by powerful stainless steel bolts (!) - a virtually unprecedented solution. Of course, the resulting yacht is not a piece of cake, but a small amount of displacement from open sea cruisers is not required.
The interior of the yacht is very elegant, made of a rather rare caia wood, which is a type of mahogany wood. The interior layout with two separated saloons (dining and coffee) is typical of many Swedish yachts with North Sea architecture.

The current Regina 43 Mk II model is the second reincarnation of the famous Regina 43 model, which has long been the calling card of the shipyard. The yacht differs noticeably from many of her classmates in a number of unusual layouts and layouts: for example, a fairly advanced bulwark that significantly increases safety on the upper deck in bad weather. One can also pay attention to the cockpit coamings that separate the inner space of the cockpit from the schoott winches: on the one hand, working with winches becomes a bit unusual, and on the other hand, the danger of injury by falling on the rocking side or back on the winch is completely eliminated.
The salon is also unusual - in the spirit of Scandinavian yachts it is divided into two parts: the main one in front of the navigating table and the coffee room in front«of the galley». It is interesting, that if you order as an option a non-growth covering and external painting of the case, the company will give on them a 10-year guarantee.

The Regina 38 has quickly earned a reputation for being a yacht «that is much larger on the inside than on the outside»- some practitioners seriously compare it to a 45-footer in terms of capacity and interior comfort. The interior of the yacht is also a special topic for discussion: mahogany is chosen by craftsmen so that there are at least three different shades of mahogany inside the boat. This approach gives volume to the interiors and makes the interior of the boat less dull.
The boat's sailing characteristics are good enough for an open sea cruiser: its manoeuvring angle is 45° and in winds of about 20 knots, the boat is free to go at a speed of about 9 knots. The cockpit of the yacht does not splash due to the high above-water board and developed cockpit coamings.

The Regina 35 is the smallest model in the yard's production line. Despite this, she is a typical representative of the brand: she is an expensive, very high quality yacht with an elevated saloon, opening a circular view to diners inside.
The small annual production of Regina boats allows the shipyard to pay great attention to the quality of the boats. The careful adjustment of all components and details is a characteristic feature of this brand. Another important detail is the lack of economy. The 12mm teak on deck, solid furniture rather than veneer, epoxy coverings are all part of the basic equipment of Regina yachts.

The Rustler 57 is a new flagship yacht from Rustler, known for their high-quality builds in Falmouth over the last 35 years. This yacht is the largest in their lineup, offering a blend of classic design and modern features. Designed by Stephen Jones, it maintains the elegant aesthetics Rustler is known for while providing ample space and comfort.

Sailing Performance

The Rustler 57 is a mid-displacement yacht that excels in maintaining speed once it gets going. In 12-15 knots of wind, it easily averages 8.5-9 knots, showcasing its ability to cover distances quickly. The deep, protected cockpit is a standout feature, offering a secure and comfortable sailing experience. All sailing operations can be managed from within this area, enhancing safety and convenience.

Deck Layout

The deck layout of the Rustler 57 is designed for both socializing and functionality. The cockpit is spacious, with ample seating and a large fixed table ideal for entertaining. The helm station features a single center wheel with good forward visibility and easy access to electronic controls for the yankee and staysail furlers. Moving forward, the deck is safe and sturdy, with high guardrails and non-slip surfaces. The boat includes a large lazarette for storage, davits for a sizeable dinghy, and a separate swim platform.

Interior Comfort

Stepping down into the semi-raised saloon, the Rustler 57 offers an open-plan layout that feels inviting and spacious. The interior prioritizes social areas, with a generous saloon, galley, and nav station. High-quality joinery, solid fiddles, and ample natural light from hull lights and overhead hatches contribute to the yacht's welcoming atmosphere. The three-cabin layout includes a forward owner's double cabin and two aft twin cabins, each with good storage and comfortable berths. The interior is customizable, with options for different wood finishes and upholstery to suit owner preferences.

Advanced Systems

The Rustler 57 is equipped with advanced systems to ensure ease of use and maintenance. The engine room and other technical spaces are easily accessible for routine maintenance. The yacht features separate panels for nav lights, 24-volt, and 240-volt systems, keeping weight central with tanks located under the saloon. The design also incorporates practical features like a proper chart table, day heads by the companionway, and ample storage throughout the boat.

The Rustler 57 stands out in the mid 50-foot luxury cruiser market by sticking to what Rustler does best—creating dependable, high-quality yachts that feel safe and comfortable. Whether cruising the West Country, exploring the Baltic, or sailing around the globe, the Rustler 57 offers a refreshing blend of tradition and modernity that will appeal to discerning sailors looking for a reliable and elegant yacht."

The Sailart 18 trailer dealership is easy to transport and suitable for short cruises or small train races. The yacht had its world premiere in January 2020.

Exterior and interior design

The project was designed by shipyard owner Frank Störck and Zdzislaw Abrozej. Sailart 18 has a modern, chopped silhouette. The casing has pronounced cheekbones and a stem with an inverse tilt.

Amenities on board

Despite its small size, the Sailart 18 has sufficient living space and is quite comfortable for two people. There is room for them to sleep and take some things on board.

Features

The boat is available in different configurations, which allows to use it as a day cruiser or as a cruiser for a small crew.

The Sailart 18 is optimized for single or twin yachtsmen. The low weight and impressive sail area characterize the yacht more like a racing boat. The boat is equipped with a 3 HP electric motor, which is powered by solar panels. The low weight of the yacht and its small size make it easy to transport it in a trailer. The sailing wardrobe includes a mainsail, jib, gennaker and code 0.


Swimming area

The yacht is designed for coastal sailing and inland waterways trips of 1-4 people. Thanks to the swivel keel the draft varies from 0.25 to 1.3m, which makes it easier to choose the route."

Exterior and interior design...

The sailboat Saffier Se 27 stands out from the crowd. Unlike the closest SC8M in size, the salon is made not in classical style, but closer to high-tech, which is noticeable in the interiors. The manufacturer also offers a choice of several colors for the design of the hull and interior spaces.

Amenities on board

Although the boat belongs to the category «of one day», it has all the comforts typical of larger models. There is a sunbathing area at the stern, comfortable tank seats in the cockpit, and up to four people can stay down for the night. The interior space has both a bathroom and a small galley, so you can spend a couple of days on a cruise with decent comfort even in company.

Features

The future owner will be able to customize his Saffier Se 27 for himself. There are three options of keels to choose from, you can choose the optimal sailing weapon (jib, genoa, Code zero), install an electric or gasoline engine, equip the boat with a tiller or steering wheel, and so on.

Swimming area

The boat is designed for short journeys in coastal waters. It certainly does not reach the year-round navigation, but for warm climate and summer walks in the fjords it is not a bad option."

The Salona 46 is a remarkable sailing yacht that embodies the perfect blend of performance and luxury. Recently unveiled at the Southampton Boat Show 2021, this world premiere highlights the yacht's exceptional design, spacious layout, and meticulous attention to detail. As a performance cruiser, the Salona 46 offers both exhilarating sailing experiences and a comfortable environment for family cruising.

Exterior and Cockpit

The Salona 46 features an expansive cockpit with twin helm positions, providing excellent control and visibility while under sail. The cockpit is beautifully laid out with teak decking, adding to the boat’s luxurious appeal. The side decks are impressively wide, ensuring easy movement around the boat, a feature that enhances safety and convenience while sailing.

Equipped with full B&G electronics, including a retractable bow thruster, electric windlass with chain counter, and state-of-the-art navigation equipment, the Salona 46 is built to perform. The cockpit also includes a retractable bathing platform that can be operated with the push of a button, adding to the boat’s convenience and functionality.

Deck and Bow

Moving towards the bow, the Salona 46 boasts a large anchor locker with plenty of space for chain storage. The design includes thoughtful features like a deep, self-draining locker specifically for storing fenders, ensuring that the deck remains clutter-free. The use of high-quality wood rails along the deck further enhances the yacht's classic and elegant aesthetic.

The Salona 46 is also fitted with powerful Lumar winches, including an electric winch, making sail handling easy and efficient. This ensures that the boat is as comfortable to handle during a leisurely cruise as it is during more intense sailing conditions.

Interior Layout

Descending below deck, the Salona 46 reveals a bright and airy interior. The quality of the woodwork is immediately noticeable, with a rich, luxurious finish throughout the cabin. The tri-cabin layout provides ample space, making it ideal for families or groups.

The aft cabins are particularly spacious, each offering large berths with plenty of natural light. Storage is abundant, with numerous cupboards, hanging lockers, and thoughtfully placed power outlets. The galley is well-equipped with a three-burner gimballed oven and hob, two refrigerators, a double sink, and plenty of work surfaces, making it perfect for preparing meals while at sea.

Saloon and Master Cabin

The saloon is a focal point of the interior, offering a comfortable and stylish area for dining and relaxation. The table in the saloon can be expanded to accommodate up to ten people, making it ideal for entertaining. The use of leather on the handrails and the integration of handholds throughout the boat emphasize the Salona 46’s suitability for performance cruising.

The master cabin, located forward, offers an abundance of space, including a private en-suite with a separate shower area. The cabin is designed with practicality in mind, offering plenty of storage space, heating vents, and high-quality finishes.

Conclusion

The Salona 46 is a stunning sailing yacht that delivers on both performance and luxury. Whether you’re looking for a yacht that can handle competitive racing or one that provides a comfortable environment for extended cruising, the Salona 46 is an excellent choice.

The Saturn 720 is an attempt to make an almost uncompromising sports yacht - small displacement, Spartan interior, aerodynamic flow and other things that only the dedicated person can understand. The yacht could be equipped with different combinations of keels and sailing weapons, which allowed sportsmen to configure the boat for «their water» area in advance.
The yacht was quite well received in the West, but her low habitability did not contribute to her popularity in her home country. At the moment, the Saturn 720 is not mass-produced and is only built to the individual orders of enthusiasts.

The Saturn 21 was designed as a comfortable small boat for lake areas, which are very numerous in Poland. Positioned as the first yacht for a young family, the Saturn 21 is easy to operate and very stable - this is achieved by the large width of the hull and a high proportion of ballast displacement (when equipped with a regular fin keel).
Despite its modest size, the yacht is well equipped - in addition to a small galley, it even has an isolated latrine in one version of the layout (it had to pay for this with one berth, of which there are four)."

The Saturn 72 is the flagship model of the company, designed and built to the highest standards. The yacht has a slightly unusual layout: firstly, with a considerable length of the boat there are only three cabins (which makes them very spacious), secondly, the salon is made on different levels - the left part of it (with a dining table) is raised relative to the right part by almost 450 millimeters. Another unusual detail is that the navigator's seat is moved out of the cabin into a separate compartment next to the galley. An important point is that with this layout, the galley and the navigator's seat are located next to the DH and, as a result, rocking is least felt there.
However, the shipyard is ready to build a yacht with a very high degree of customisation: right up to the moulding of the deck section in accordance with the customer's wishes regarding the size and shape of the cockpit.

However, a number of experts believe that due to the hard work of Taiwanese workers and the exceptionally high quality materials used to build this boat, it is superior in quality to most of them.
Curiously, the yacht can be delivered with two layouts, one normal and one raised saloon (400mm).

The Saturn 47 is the youngest model of the shipyard, with the first yacht touching the water in the summer of 2009. This yacht with its North European architecture (central cockpit) is exceptionally reliable: in addition to the high quality isophthalic resin used to mould the hull section, for example, the two outer layers of glass fabric are laminated using even more expensive epoxy resin. In this way, the owner can simply forget the osmosis problem forever. The same can be said for the rest of the boat: the resin, glass fabric, stainless steel, mahogany and teak were clearly not saved during construction.
The yacht is not a heavy-duty boat, however, with a wind speed of about 8 m/s the yacht can easily reach speeds above 9.5 knots.

The Seawind 1370 is a brand-new 45-foot performance cruising catamaran designed with live-aboard couples in mind. Built by Seawind Catamarans, a company with over 30 years of experience in the industry, and designed by the renowned French naval architect François Perus, the Seawind 1370 is engineered to offer the perfect balance between performance and comfort for long-term blue water cruising. This catamaran is set to be a game-changer for those seeking a home on the water, equipped with innovative features and designed for life off the grid.

Exterior Design and Deck Layout

The Seawind 1370 is designed for both functionality and comfort. One of the standout features is the ergonomic helm station, which offers full 360-degree visibility, essential for safe navigation. The helm is equipped with armrests, footrests, cupholders, and self-draining lockers, ensuring that everything is within easy reach and designed for comfort during long passages.

The aft deck is expansive, with a tri-fold door that creates a seamless indoor-outdoor living area. This design maximizes the use of space, allowing for a large social area at the stern that is perfect for relaxing or entertaining. The hard Bimini provides protection from the elements while incorporating solar panels that generate up to 2 kilowatts of power. Storage for paddleboards, fishing rods, and other equipment is cleverly integrated, making it a highly practical space for those who enjoy various water activities.

A notable feature is the dedicated life raft compartment at the stern, designed for quick deployment in an emergency. The life raft can be in the water within 30 seconds, a critical safety feature for long-distance cruisers.

Interior Layout and Comfort

The interior of the Seawind 1370 is designed with live-aboard comfort in mind. The saloon features modular seating, allowing for flexible arrangements depending on the situation. The large, opening windows ensure excellent ventilation, a must-have for tropical cruising. The forward-facing nav station is equipped with 360-degree visibility, allowing for full control of the boat from inside the cabin, making it ideal for all-weather sailing.

The galley is designed with practicality in mind, featuring Corian work surfaces, an induction stove, a dedicated waste chute, and multiple fridge and refrigeration options. These features are designed to make life on board as comfortable and self-sufficient as possible, particularly important for those planning extended voyages.

The cabins are designed for comfort and convenience, with island beds, multiple charging points, and plenty of storage. The master cabin features a vanity unit that doubles as a desk, perfect for those who need a workspace on board. The heads are equipped with electric toilets, separate shower stalls, and direct engine room access, making maintenance easier and more convenient.

Performance and Power Management

The Seawind 1370 is built for performance, with a tall rig and a sail plan that includes an 861-square-foot mainsail and a 387-square-foot jib. This sailing catamaran is designed to be fast and efficient, capable of reaching speeds of up to 20 knots in 25 knots of wind, with the wind at 110 degrees. Even with a full payload, the boat can achieve 19 knots, making it one of the fastest cruising catamarans in its class.

For power generation, the Seawind 1370 is equipped with 2 kilowatts of solar panels on the hardtop, which is more than sufficient to power the boat's systems. The boat is also fitted with diesel engines and Mastervolt's 200-amp alternators, which can produce 5 kilowatts of power when the engines are running. This setup ensures that the lithium battery bank can be fully charged with just a few hours of engine use, providing a thousand miles of range using the diesel engines.

Conclusion

The Seawind 1370 is the ideal catamaran for live-aboard couples looking to embark on long-term blue water cruising. Its innovative design, combined with Seawind’s decades of experience and the practical input from seasoned live-aboard sailors, results in a yacht that offers comfort, safety, and outstanding performance. Whether you’re planning to explore remote corners of the globe or simply enjoy extended cruising in comfort, the Seawind 1370 is designed to meet and exceed expectations."

Period of manufacture

The Shogun 43 is a high-performance sailing yacht built in Sweden, designed to offer a seamless blend of speed and comfort. This full carbon build is tailored for those who love the thrill of sailing without sacrificing onboard luxury. While it performs like a race boat, the Shogun 43 is not stripped down but offers a cozy and comfortable interior.

Exterior Design and Features

The Shogun 43 boasts a sleek, modern design with advanced carbon fiber construction that enhances both strength and lightness. This innovative approach ensures that the boat is incredibly stiff and light, allowing it to plane in strong winds and reach speeds exceeding 20 knots. The deck is designed with practicality in mind, featuring large carbon fiber wheels and all necessary navigation and sail controls strategically placed for optimal sailing performance. The hull design is unique, with the molding wrapping all the way around, creating a super stiff and lightweight structure.

Interior Comfort and Luxury

Inside, the Shogun 43 offers a surprisingly comfortable and inviting space, quite different from what one might expect from a high-performance yacht. The open-plan layout ensures a spacious feel, with plenty of natural light streaming in from both hull and deck windows. The carbon fiber mast extends through the boat, adding to the aesthetic appeal while highlighting the yacht's performance pedigree. The forward section houses a double bed with ample storage in hanging lockers. The saloon features a fold-out table that doubles in size for dining, and the galley is well-equipped with twin sinks, a gimbaled cooker, and top-loading refrigeration to prevent spills during sailing.

Technical Specifications and Performance

The Shogun 43 is built for high performance, utilizing lightweight core wood that feels solid yet is incredibly light. The emphasis on weight reduction without compromising strength is evident throughout the yacht. The twin cabins offer comfortable sleeping arrangements with additional storage spaces, while the heads feature a carbon fiber toilet, emphasizing the yacht's commitment to using advanced materials. The auxiliary engine, a 30 horsepower Volvo Penta D1-30, is compact yet efficient, sufficient for harbor maneuvering but underscoring that this yacht is all about sailing.

Deck Layout and Sailing Features

On deck, the Shogun 43 continues to impress with its thoughtful design. The compact engine allows for a large storage area aft, and clever features like adjustable helm footrests enhance comfort while sailing at an angle. The rigging is state-of-the-art, featuring Kevlar lines for maximum strength and minimal weight. The deck layout includes slab reefing and an enormous carbon fiber rig, with all lines leading aft for easy handling. The bow is equipped with roller furling and a bowsprit, ideal for deploying sails like the Code Zero.

The Shogun 43's deck is not only practical but also stylish, with innovative cleats that fold flat to prevent snagging lines. The large storage areas and modern rigging make it clear that this yacht is designed for serious sailing enthusiasts.

Conclusion

The Shogun 43 is a remarkable yacht that combines high-performance sailing with the comfort and amenities of a luxury cruiser. Its advanced carbon fiber construction, innovative design features, and comfortable interior make it an excellent choice for sailors who want both speed and comfort. Whether racing or cruising, the Shogun 43 offers an exhilarating sailing experience without compromising on luxury."

This yacht exudes craftsmanship with a wood-epoxy construction that sets it apart from conventional yachts. With its sleek profile and meticulously designed interior, the Spirit 65DH is a true work of art on the water, embodying both classic appeal and modern functionality.

Exterior Design and Sustainability

Period of manufacture
from 2020",https://itboat.com/models/12672-spirit-44cre,"Spirit 44CR(e) Overview

The Spirit 44CR(e) represents a revolutionary step in yachting, blending classic design with modern innovation. Built by Spirit Yachts, a company known for its elegant wooden vessels, this is the first fully electric cruising yacht in their lineup. The Spirit 44CR(e) offers not only stunning aesthetics but also cutting-edge technology beneath its traditional exterior.

Exterior and Performance

The Spirit 44CR(e) impresses with its light displacement of under seven tonnes, which is remarkable for a 44-foot yacht. This, combined with a tall carbon rig and one-piece sails, gives the boat a sporty performance on the water. Her deep keel and carbon spade rudder provide excellent maneuverability, allowing for sharp tacks and responsive handling. The narrow beam keeps the sailor close to the water, enhancing the connection to the sailing experience. Additionally, the use of Lignia wood for the decks—a sustainable alternative to teak—demonstrates Spirit’s commitment to eco-friendly materials.

Cockpit and Helm Station

The deep and secure cockpit is well-designed for both comfort and functionality. A large 40-inch wheel allows easy control from either side, and all necessary controls, including the main sheet and backstay adjustments, are within reach of the helm. For solo sailors, the boat's autopilot and wheel-locking capabilities make it easy to maintain course without constant input. The use of EC3 carbon rigging further reduces weight and enhances performance, while two bespoke Solbian solar panels on the quarterdeck supply additional power, reinforcing the boat’s sustainable design.

Interior and Accommodation

Inside, the Spirit 44CR(e) offers a cozy, timber-filled space. Though smaller than a typical production cruiser of the same size, the well-utilized layout creates a warm and practical environment. The saloon features a C-shaped seating area and a straight settee, both long enough to serve as seaberths. The galley is compact yet functional, equipped with a double sink, alcohol stove, and ample storage. The forward owner’s cabin offers a V-berth with wide foot space, while the aft cabins provide flexibility with single berths or a double setup. The electric motor, located midships, saves significant space compared to a diesel engine.

Conclusion

The Spirit 44CR(e) is a stunning combination of classic craftsmanship and modern sustainability. Its electric propulsion and eco-friendly materials make it nearly fossil fuel-free, pushing the boundaries of yacht design."

The interior of the Sunreef 60 Eco is designed with understated luxury, featuring Burmese reclaimed teak floors and natural teak veneer throughout. The saloon is spacious and decorated in a Zen style with black, silver, and gray tones, complemented by a private art collection. The cabins are designed with a unique color scheme for practical purposes, ensuring that each cabin has distinct towels and glass colors. The master cabin boasts Carrara marble in the shower and Lalique toiletries.

Sustainable Features

The yacht's sustainable approach extends to its air conditioning system, which can run throughout the night without generators, powered by the propulsion battery bank. The yacht also uses a silicon-based antifouling coating, contributing to an additional knot in cruising speed by reducing chemical use.

This yacht not only provides a luxurious sailing experience but also represents a significant step towards sustainable yachting."

The fourth model in the New Beginning range, the Sunreef 70, was presented in early 2019.

Exterior and Interior Design

Announced in 2017, Sunreef's line of sailing catamarans combines opposites. Inspired by classic designs, the New Beginning series looks ultramodern. It already has 50,60 and 80 models, which have collected a number of international awards.

Designed by in-house designers, the Sunreef 70 offers an impressive space to relax at sea. The hull and superstructure have been designed to provide maximum comfort for guests and crew, both on the move and in the car park.

Amenities on board

Positioned as a builder of semi-custom catamarans, Sunreef offers the owner ample opportunity to customize the boat. The impressive size of the catamaran, which is 21 m long and 10.5 m wide, allows you to fantasize boldly. What's worth it is the master stateroom, under which the entire left hull is placed.

Features

Sunreef has been astonished with its designs many times and the 70th will not spoil the yard's reputation. The model has all the modern «chips»associated with the convenience of relaxation on board. They are also very environmentally friendly boats - environmental care is Sunreef's philosophy.

Swimming area

In the early 2000s Sunreef built aluminium catamarans, i.e. their seaworthiness was unquestioned. Now, apart from a few carbon fibre models, Sunreef boats are composite. When properly built, they are lighter and faster than aluminium boats and are capable of handling long journeys as well. Especially in such an impressive size."

Period of manufacture
from 2017",https://itboat.com/models/7621-sunreef-60,"Sunreef 60 Overview

The Sunreef 60 is a luxurious sailing catamaran designed for comfort, performance, and extensive cruising. Known for its spacious layout and innovative design, it is ideal for long voyages and entertaining guests.

Swim Platform

At the back of the Sunreef 60, the swim platform doubles as a tender lift and teak beach area. This feature enhances the boat's versatility and social space, especially useful when docked at floating docks. The platform can extend the cockpit area, making it a great spot for nighttime entertainment.

Cockpit

The cockpit of the Sunreef 60 is designed for both relaxation and social gatherings. It features a beautiful teak table and a wet bar for cold storage. The cockpit seamlessly connects to the interior salon through four sliding doors, which can be adjusted to open fully or partially, depending on your preference. The teak finishes extend into the interior, creating a cohesive and luxurious feel.

Galley and Salon

The galley is centrally located and raised, offering a great space for entertaining and family gatherings. It features lightweight ceramic surfaces that mimic the look of stone but are more sustainable and lighter. The galley-up design promotes a family-friendly environment and makes it ideal for hosting cooking classes or other events.

The salon is spacious and feels larger than typical catamarans due to its design and the large windows that offer panoramic views. The integrated ship systems allow easy control of all lights, tank levels, and other essential functions from a central touchscreen.

Master Staterooms

The Sunreef 60 features two master staterooms, each with unique configurations:

Starboard Master Stateroom:

A large athwartship bunk.
Three vertical windows providing natural light.
Abundant storage, including hanging lockers and induction charging stations.
An ensuite head with a teak finish, ceramic counters, and a rain shower.

Port Master Stateroom:

Similar athwartship bunk and window configuration.
Additional features like an ensuite washer/dryer.
Separation from the crew quarters for added privacy.
Guest Cabins

The guest cabins are well-appointed with comfortable beds, ample storage, and stylish finishes. These cabins are designed to provide a cozy and private space for guests, ensuring a luxurious stay on board.

Bow and Flybridge

The bow area includes a sunken lounge and trampoline, perfect for sunbathing and relaxing. This space also facilitates natural ventilation through the boat when the forward door is open.

The flybridge is a standout feature with extensive teak decking, a hardtop with glass panels for sky views, and ample seating for socializing. It includes a full-size grill and a carbon fiber boom, designed for performance sailing. The helm station offers great visibility and control, featuring Harkin power winches and a carbon fiber wheel.

Conclusion

The Sunreef 60 is a versatile and luxurious sailing catamaran, perfect for those who enjoy entertaining and extensive cruising. Its thoughtful design, sustainable materials, and advanced systems make it a top choice in the luxury catamaran market."

The exterior and interior design

Designed by the in-house firm Sunreef 50, the shipyard's 15th anniversary line of semi-custom sailing catamarans New Beginning opens. Her special feature is a fusion of tradition and modernity. There are no sharp angles, lots of teak in the exterior, which appeals to the classics, but the equipment and decoration of the boats is ultramodern. A bold solution: a hydraulic platform at the stern, the task of which is to extend the relaxation area in case the bow lounge area and the flybridge with bar can not accommodate all guests. As always in this layout, all spaces (except the flybridge) are on the same level and open for movement.

Amenities on board

The organization of living space for 167 squares is provided to the customer. Hull #1 is made in three cabin version, where one side is fully owned by the owners. Two or four en-suite cabins are available. Special Offer: Sunreef 50 Amber Limited Edition with a fascinating black and amber finish (only 10 hulls will be available).

Features

The most compact catamaran in the shipyard's elite sailing range, the Sunreef 50, will be the mass-produced model, but the owners will not feel left out. The amenities of model 50 are as good as the «older sisters». Let's be frank, the 15-meter catamaran looks very impressive.

Swimming area

1000 litres of fuel and 800 litres of water talk about long journeys, but the number of lounges and dining areas suggests that this contradicts the philosophy of hedonism. And the only wheelhouse on the flybridge is unlikely to be comfortable in bad weather."

Designed by Seb Schmidt, known for his racing background, the S48 blends performance-driven hulls with lightweight materials like carbon fiber, ensuring both agility and efficiency for cruising.

Design and Build

Weighing in at 11 tons, the S48 features a sleek design with fine entry bows and a carbon rig, contributing to its reported slipperiness through the water. The entire structure, including hulls and bridge deck, is infused in a single mold for enhanced stiffness and reduced weight. Customizability is a key feature, allowing owners to tailor most aspects to their preferences.

Onboard Features

Internally, the S48 prioritizes central weight distribution, with components like batteries and generators strategically placed for optimal balance. The owner's hull incorporates carbon frame bulkheads and uni-directional carbon stringers, emphasizing structural integrity and weight efficiency.

Additional Features

Unique features include integrated eyes for tethers and lifelines, enhancing safety onboard. The cockpit design includes a clever solution for the dinghy, which integrates with the bench and is easily stowed using electric engines.

Conclusion

The Tartan 5300 has been designed specifically for long-range cruising and is positioned as an intermediate between long-range and high-speed cruisers. The long waterline and good length/water-displacement ratio indicate that this yacht is capable of high speeds in passing winds, while the sharp waterlines in the bow and the large enough width in the stern ensure a good ride even on sharp courses. The absence of tilting waterlines ensures good handling and stability even on a strong roll.
Traditional Tartan yachts are highly efficient sailing weapons and low center of gravity. The very high quality interior and the architecture with the raised saloon and the cockpit shifted to the center complete the description of this expensive but interesting boat.

R4
Period of manufacture
from 2022",https://itboat.com/models/14856-vaan-yachts-r4,"Vaan R4 Overview

The Vaan R4 is not just another catamaran; it’s a statement in sustainable yacht design. Built primarily from recycled aluminum, the Vaan R4 combines innovative eco-friendly materials with the luxury and performance expected from a modern sailing vessel. As a series production catamaran made from aluminum, this yacht is rare, and its commitment to sustainability sets it apart in an industry where greenwashing is all too common.

Design and Performance

Measuring 13.65 meters in length, the Vaan R4 is designed with both performance and sustainability in mind. The yacht is powered by an electric propulsion system, offering a choice between Oceanvolt or Torqeedo motors, with battery options ranging from 28 to 57 kWh. The electric engines run quietly, enhancing the sailing experience, especially in favorable wind conditions of 15 to 18 knots. With its nearly 11-ton weight, the catamaran achieves optimal performance at 35 degrees to the wind, reaching speeds just under 6 knots. The optional deeper keel allows for even better upwind performance.

Sustainable Materials and Construction

The Vaan R4's sustainability credentials are impressive. Constructed from 60-85% recycled aluminum, sourced from items like old window frames and license plates, the yacht is built to withstand seawater while minimizing its environmental footprint. Aluminum is chosen for its 100% recyclability and lower melting point, which requires less energy compared to traditional fiberglass construction. Additionally, the boat features FSC-certified decking, upholstery made from recycled materials, and natural fiber carpets, all emphasizing the yacht’s eco-friendly focus.

Comfort and Customization

Inside, the Vaan R4 offers spacious and comfortable living quarters. The open design philosophy ensures ample room and freedom of movement, a true luxury in yachting. The port hull houses a long passageway with optional overhead cabinets, leading to a well-appointed bathroom. The aft cabins provide comfortable sleeping arrangements with wide berths, and the salon continues the theme of space and openness. Vaan Yachts offers a high level of customization, allowing owners to tailor the yacht to their preferences, ensuring both comfort and functionality."

Wasa Atlantic was commissioned by a group of faithful shipyard customers who felt they had ""outgrown"" the existing range of yachts and needed something larger. This required that the new yacht not only maintained the usual racing qualities of a yacht, but that it would be much more 'out of touch' with its predecessors. It is said - done: the shipyard has created a very unusual boat, the narrowest in the range, very light and with a large sailing area.
Initially the shipyard did not intend to bring this boat to the wide market, leaving it a kind of exclusive, accessible only for regular customers - the special status of the boat was further emphasized by an unusual index in the name.

The Wasa 530 is the first departure from its corporate concept of creating family cruising yachts that are nonetheless suitable for the most adventurous «races. Originally designed as a pure long-haul cruiser, she was fast but not optimised for any racing rules.
However, the interior and the layout of the yacht - according to the wishes of the first customer - are more like racing. She has only two cabins at the stern (and one of them with hanging bunks) and a cockpit with four more hanging bunks in the bow instead of the owner's expected large cabin. However, the boat is spacious, has large storage and provisioning spaces, and even a small workshop has been fenced off.
The speed of the yacht was at an expected level, with the first owner estimating that the 50-mile distance travelled in just three hours during one of the crossings.

In addition to this yacht, the surface board was also increased, retaining the main advantage of the prototype - low displacement. Indeed, 8 tons is very small for a 42-footer.

The Wasa 41 marked the transition from outdated IOR rules to modern IMS. Maintaining the ideology of a family cruiser with good racing capabilities, the Wasa Yachts specialists have created a new boat that is already openly positioned as a racing boat. Cruising qualities came second - the very first yacht to be built had a racing interior with lightweight hanging bunks and minimal trim.
This radicalism was later found to be superfluous, and for subsequent builds the deckhouse height had to be increased slightly to give more space in the sub-deck areas. However, even with a normal«cruising» interior, the boat has retained its excellent racing potential - the 5,850 kilos displacement is quite small for a 40-foot cruiser. And if we also take into account the fact that the share of ballast in the boat's displacement is 45 percent, the appearance of the tiger in sheep«'s skin becomes» clear.

The Swedish designers were very successful in optimising the yacht for these rules - almost the very first sailing of a new yacht ended in a victory in Kiel week in her class. By modifying the keel, rudder and sailing weapons, the firm's specialists have ensured that the boat remains quite competitive in races held under the rules of IMS.

The concept and overall layout has been retained as a well-proven family yacht, suitable for both long distance cruising and IMS or IRM racing. Considering the «birthplace of the yacht» - and the Swedish coast is full of skerries and small islands - the designers tried to give the yacht a particularly good maneuverability, which they managed to achieve to the full extent: on the narrow fairways of the northern Wasa 370 skerries - the queen.
Despite the fact that the designers thought about good sports results when designing the boat, the boat was made so that it could be easily operated by a small crew. Reliability and quality of construction quickly gained confidence of sail lovers - in the secondary market the Wasa 370 is in good demand and has little loss in price.

The Wave 50 is a revolutionary 50-foot catamaran that stands out with its innovative design, which feels much larger than its dimensions suggest. It made its debut at the 2021 Cannes Yachting Festival, and despite its unconventional exterior, it offers a surprisingly spacious and luxurious interior, akin to a 60-foot or larger yacht.

Exterior Design

The Wave 50’s exterior design is distinctive, featuring wave-like curves throughout the superstructure. The hydraulic swim platform at the aft serves as a multifunctional area, transforming into a beach club or tender storage, with foldable sides that provide additional support for a dinghy. The flybridge, equipped with a retractable soft top, offers great visibility and ease of sail handling, making it perfect for short-handed sailing. The flybridge also doubles as an outdoor entertainment area with a projector for movie nights.

Interior

Upon entering the salon, the Wave 50 impresses with its spaciousness and natural light, which makes it feel more like a 60-foot yacht. The salon features a large L-shaped sofa, a kitchen island with a single and rinsing basin, a full-sized refrigerator, and a wine cooler. The interior decor is elegant, providing a luxurious and comfortable atmosphere with plenty of seating. A television is recessed behind the bar, adding to the entertainment features.

Cabins

The Wave 50 has four guest staterooms, though the cabins are more modest in size compared to the salon. The starboard aft cabin serves as the crew cabin. Each stateroom features a queen-sized bed with vertical windows providing natural light. The en-suite heads include separate shower stalls, single-basin sinks, and Tecma freshwater toilets. The cabins on the port side are slightly larger, with the aft port cabin having a king-sized bed and generous storage space.

Forward Cockpit

One of the standout features of the Wave 50 is the forward cockpit, which is protected by a hard top, offering a shaded area with an L-shaped seating arrangement. The forward cockpit also includes trampolines for lounging and a wet bar with a sink, refrigerator, and ice maker, making it a perfect space for socializing and relaxing. This cockpit design is considered one of the best among catamarans of its size.

Conclusion

The Wave 50 is an unconventional yet highly innovative catamaran that offers the comfort, space, and amenities of a much larger yacht. With its unique design, luxurious interior, and versatile outdoor areas, it stands out as one of the most impressive and forward-thinking catamarans at the Cannes Yachting Festival. Ideal for those seeking a yacht that combines functionality with modern design."

The Wave 58 is a pretty expensive vessel, positioned by its creators even a little higher than the expensive French catamarans in the series. Privilege and with a layout that is not common on such boats, with two cabins arranged transversely on the bow of the bridge. With this layout, the hulls become freer (one of the hull cabins moves «to the bridge»), as a consequence, the entire right hull is given to the owner's suite: in addition to the cabin and a fairly spacious walk-in closet, there is a small office on the bow. It can be used as an office or workshop, as desired by the owner. However, this is only one of the possible layouts for such a vessel, as the almost 60-foot size gives designers a wide range of freedom in choosing layouts (in particular, one of the options is to arrange the galley... in the stern of the left hull. But the internal salon turns out simply huge). Some unusual architecture of the catamaran (its hulls have an elliptical cross-section with a narrowing to the upper deck) associated with high-speed multihulls, makes the Wave 58 stand out from the list of similar catamarans."

The Windelo 50 is the latest innovation from Windelo, a new shipyard focused on creating sustainable, performance-oriented catamarans. Built with eco-friendly materials and designed for both comfort and speed, the Windelo 50 aims to redefine modern catamaran sailing.

Sailing Experience

The Windelo 50 offers a different sailing experience, particularly when sailing upwind. The boat’s design centers around a forward cockpit, providing a social and connected environment. With the twin wheels positioned centrally, the sailing experience is comfortable and stable, even in choppy seas. The central positioning reduces movement, making for a smoother ride.

While sailing beam-reaching with the Code Zero, the Windelo 50 showcases its performance capabilities, averaging speeds of 11-12 knots and reaching up to 14 knots in 16 knots of wind. The setup allows for easy handling of the sails without leaving the cockpit, adding to the boat's user-friendly nature.

Sustainable Design

Windelo has made significant strides in using sustainable materials in the construction of the 50. The boat is made from basalt fiber, a material derived from volcanic rock, which is 50% lighter than traditional glass fiber and recyclable. The foam core is made from recycled plastic bottles (PET), emphasizing the shipyard’s commitment to sustainability.

The boat is equipped with electric Bellmarine engines, which are quiet and efficient. These engines also serve as hydro-generators, putting energy back into the batteries while sailing. The Windelo 50 can run four hours at six knots on battery power alone, with a diesel generator as a range extender for longer passages.

Exterior Features

The Windelo 50 boasts an extensive use of solar panels, with up to 3.5 kilowatts of flexible solar panels on the coach roof. This setup ensures that the boat’s DC systems can be powered sustainably, capturing energy from the sun.

The design includes a large, extendable bathing platform that doubles as davits for lowering the dinghy. This platform significantly extends the cockpit area, creating a seamless inside-outside living space. The forward cockpit design allows for excellent social interaction, making it a unique feature among catamarans.

Interior Comfort

The interior of the Windelo 50 is designed to be open, modern, and filled with natural light. The saloon features large sliding windows, allowing for excellent ventilation and a connection to the outdoors. The galley is integrated into the saloon, promoting social interaction and ease of use while sailing.

The owner’s hull features a transverse queen-sized bed with a beautiful corner window, providing panoramic views. The layout can be customized to include an office space or additional bunks, depending on the owner's needs. The heads and shower areas are spacious and built around the central daggerboard casing.

The guest cabins are equally comfortable, with options for a conventional double or a transverse bunk layout. Each cabin includes plenty of storage and large windows for natural light.

Practicality and Performance

The Windelo 50 is built for long-term cruising with a payload capacity of up to 16 tons. The boat’s design includes ample storage throughout, from the large sail locker to various interior compartments. The central positioning of fuel tanks and storage near the mast base enhances weight distribution and performance.

The boat features a bowsprit and self-tacking jib, allowing for easy handling and versatility in different wind conditions. The electric engines provide quiet and efficient motoring, with the ability to regenerate power while sailing.

Conclusion

The Windelo 50 stands out as a sustainable, performance-oriented catamaran with a modern design and comfortable living spaces. Its innovative use of eco-friendly materials, combined with thoughtful design features, make it an excellent choice for long-term cruisers seeking both performance and sustainability. With its unique layout and impressive sailing capabilities, the Windelo 50 is set to make a significant impact in the world of catamarans."

Period of manufacture

Exterior and Interior Design

Introduced in 2016, the XRange range is designed to combine the perfomance and cruise features of the Danish company X-Yachts. The sailing yacht X4⁰ is the «youngest in the» series and celebrates the shipyard's 40th anniversary. The length of 12m is very popular on the market and for X-Yachts Design Team it is not the first job of this size. The shipyard's DNA can be seen in everything. Above all, it's a powerful hull without finesse - aligned lines and profiles ensure speed. Plus significant weight reduction. New developments here include a rigging system and a cockpit work area. Inside, traditional minimalism: simple shapes and lots of light. «Scandinavian oak» is available with many interior and furniture finishing options as standard.

Amenities on board

X4⁰'s first models will only go on the market as a two-cabin version. From 2020, a three cabin layout will be available. In general, everything is standard and simple. For example, in both versions there is only one shower cabin and latrines. It's a Scandinavian chic.

Features

With external modesty X4⁰ the boat is not simple. The steel «spider» in the hull will provide rigidity. Great possibilities to adjust sails (only in cockpit four winches). Standard draft is 2.1 m (with an option of 2.3 m)! All indications are that this is a «pocket rocket» for reasonable money. Is it a joke: in three years of the XRange line's existence, 120 hulls have been built.

Swimming area

No matter how hard X-Yachts try, these boats are always associated with speed. So why don't the small crew set off for an offshore regatta in the Mediterranean or North Sea? You won't be an outsider. The boat guarantees it."

The Farr 36 is another example of the company's strict racing monotype. Farr Yacht Designdesigned for both short distance and open sea gambling. The yacht is built from carbon fabric filled with balsa wood, which guarantees her low displacement, while she has an exceptionally deep (2.6 meters!) ballast keel. She weighs more than 45% of her displacement, which guarantees excellent stability and the ability to carry full sails for very long periods of time with stronger wind. A huge 150m² spinnaker completes the picture of a giant yacht «killer: the»energy structure of the boat under the spinnaker exceeds the notorious 50m²/tonne, allowing her to go out for full hydroplaning.

At the same time the boat is relatively easy for inexperienced yachtsmen, but a sophisticated crew can reward with fantastic speeds."

The purpose of Mumm 30 was to create a modern sports keel yacht that would be fast and interesting for racers, while remaining relatively simple and not very expensive. Bruce Farr's Design Bureau started to build the Mumm 30 from scratch, with constant brainstorming about: What would make the boat «faster and more excited on the go?» A yacht has a very high moment of stability, which gives her the opportunity to carry full sails longer and reduces the need for heavy weight to open.
The Mumm 30 is a very fast and well controlled boat on both sharp and full courses. It is comparatively easy for beginners (due in no small part to the lack of backstags), but can also be enjoyed by experienced yachtsmen.

Simplicity of construction and control of the yacht, as well as its great durability and reliability were the main focus of the creation of the boat. The boat received a very reliable hull with high stability, a powerful rubberized welded bar, softening blows during rough mooring (which is a frequent sin for novice yachtsmen), a light scheme of installation of a removable keel, a large vertical dimension between the boom and the deck, making it easier to transfer the crew from one side to another.
